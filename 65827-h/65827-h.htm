<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>This little volume deals only with seven
years in the life of Frederick the Great,
but they were seven of the most memorable
years in the history of Austria and
Prussia&mdash;the period of the Seven Years&rsquo; War,
which confirmed to Frederick the possession of
Silesia, and elevated Prussia to the first rank among
European states. Three times Frederick waged war
for its possession: the first time, in 1740-42, with
Saxony, Bavaria, and France for allies against Austria
and Great Britain; the second time, in 1744-45,
when Austria was aided by Saxony; and the third
time, in 1756-63, when Prussia, aided by some of
the small German states and British subsidies, fought
Austria, France, Russia, Sweden, and Saxony. The
Seven Years&rsquo; War was one of the greatest and most
destructive wars of the eighteenth century, both to
victors and vanquished. Frederick and his allies
met with but five defeats in this war,&mdash;Kollin,
Hastenbeck, Grossj&auml;gerndorf, Hochkirch, and Kunersdorf,&mdash;the
last a most crushing defeat; but they
won ten great victories, Lobositz, Prague, Rossbach,
Leuthen, Zorndorf, Minden, Liegnitz, Torgau,
Burkersdorf, and Freiberg; and in eight of these
Frederick commanded in person, and in every case
with a much smaller force than that of his enemies.
Peace was finally made with Maria Theresa in 1763,
and by a clear violation of ancient faith and treaty
rights Silesia was taken from her. The various
campaigns are described briefly and yet in such a
manner that the interest of the narrative is kept up
to the last, and the author, by the introduction of
anecdotes, conversations, and fragments of letters,
brings out very clearly the peculiar traits of the
great king&mdash;his courage at one time, his despondent
moods at others, his obstinacy and self-conceit,
which more than once involved him in disaster,
his humor and satire, his cruelty at times to his
own troops, and again his fatherly relations to them.
It is also a thrilling period of history with which
the author deals, and replete with national as well
as individual interest. Of the close of this great
and sanguinary war, Macaulay says,&mdash;and he was
not an admirer of Frederick,&mdash;&ldquo;The proud and
revengeful spirit of the Empress-Queen at length
gave way; and in February, 1763, the peace of
Hubertsburg put an end to the conflict which
had during seven years devastated Germany. The
king ceded nothing. The whole Continent in arms
had proved unable to tear Silesia from that iron
grasp. The war was over. Frederick was safe.
His glory was beyond the reach of envy. If he
had not made conquests as vast as those of Alexander,
of C&aelig;sar, and of Napoleon,&mdash;if he had not,
on field of battle, enjoyed the constant success of
Marlborough and Wellington,&mdash;he had yet given
an example unrivalled in history, of what capacity
and resolution can effect against the greatest superiority
of power and the utmost spite of fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Chapter I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The First Battle of the War</span></h2>
<p>What a glorious period of peace Germany
enjoyed after the furious storms
of war had devastated its flourishing
provinces and brought ruin and death
into so many homes! Prussia at this time had to
stand the brunt of the storm, and had it not been
for the indomitable spirit and great military skill of
Frederick the Great, nothing could have saved the
young kingdom from being forced back within the
limits of its original territory. It was not the fault
of its enemies that the effort failed. They left nothing
undone to humiliate and subdue Prussia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Maria Theresa was never reconciled to the loss
of Silesia, which had been taken from her by Frederick
in the preceding war with Austria. They said
that she shed tears whenever she saw a Silesian.
Cherishing such a strong attachment, it is not remarkable
that the high-spirited Empress busied
herself with schemes for the recovery of her lost
province. With this purpose in view, she made
secret treaties with Russia, France, and Sweden, and
was also assured of the help of Saxony and many of
the German imperial princes. Thus united, the
plan was made to seize Prussia and reduce it to its
old limits of the Mark of Brandenburg,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
at the same time allotting Silesia to Austria, Westphalia to
France, the bishopric of Magdeburg to Saxony,
Pomerania to Sweden, and Prussia to Russia; but
Frederick&rsquo;s sharp eyes discovered the designs of his
enemies at an early stage in the game. Two traitors
assisted him. Wenzel, a secretary in Dresden, and
Weingarten, an <i>attach&eacute;</i> of the Austrian embassy
in Berlin, were paid for warning him of the impending
danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Frederick quietly and speedily formed his counterplans.
He strengthened his army, concluded a
subsidy agreement with England&mdash;which at that
time was under the Hanoverian dynasty&mdash;and also
secured promise of help from some of the German
princes, particularly the dukes of Brunswick and
Gotha and the Elector of Hesse-Cassel. With this
comparatively small array he boldly prepared to
oppose his powerful enemies. His motto was
&ldquo;Nothing venture, nothing have.&rdquo; He quietly
placed his army upon a war footing, concentrated
it at a given point, and then gave the order to
march into Saxony.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Frederick&rsquo;s army invaded that beautiful and fruitful
country in three divisions, while Field-Marshal
Schwerin, with a fourth, occupied Bohemia. In a
few days its most important cities were in his possession.
The invasion was effected with such startling
quickness that the Elector and his family barely
escaped being taken prisoners, but they were all
treated with proper respect. The unexpected occupation
caused great alarm all over Saxony, and the
news of it created consternation at the Austrian
court. Frederick was charged with bad faith and
disturbance of the country&rsquo;s peace. The Emperor
went so far as to characterize the bold intruders as
outlaws. Frederick, however, was not disturbed.
All that he cared for was the rupture of the alliance
between the Elector and Austria. Not succeeding
in this at the outset, he treated that province as an
enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>The Saxon army, in the meantime, had camped
at Pirna,<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
so as to be in easy communication with
the Austrian forces, but Frederick shut them in so
closely that they were soon in desperate straits.
The Elector despatched messenger after messenger
to Maria Theresa, praying for help. Alarmed at last
by the bold operations of the King, she granted
his requests and sent Field-Marshal Browne with
seventy thousand men to the relief of Saxony, not
doubting that he would crush Frederick at the first
blow. Frederick, however, did not wait for the
arrival of his enemy, but, dividing his force, boldly
went out to meet him with about twenty-four thousand
men, leaving the other half to watch the
Saxons at Pirna.</p>
<p>The two armies met at Lobositz on the Elbe,
October 1, 1756. The battle raged fiercely for six
hours with little prospect of success for the Prussians,
considering the superior strength of the
enemy. Indeed, defeat at one time seemed inevitable,
for their ammunition was exhausted. The
brave Duke of Bevern, however, saved the army
from its first defeat. When told that they were out
of powder and shot, he coolly exclaimed: &ldquo;Comrades,
be of good courage. Charge with fixed
bayonets!&rdquo; His gallant troops obeyed, and hurled
themselves upon the Austrians with such impetuosity
that they were soon masters of the field.
This was the first victory in the Seven Years&rsquo; War.
Frederick was delighted, and on that same day
wrote to Field-Marshal Schwerin:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly need say anything to you about the
troops. You know them. But never since I have
had the honor to command them, cavalry as well as
infantry, have they fought more bravely. It is easy
to see by these brilliant achievements what they will
do hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news of the victory fell like a thunderbolt
in the ranks of the Prussian King&rsquo;s enemies. The
Saxon troops at Pirna, fourteen thousand strong,
forced by bitter necessity and half starved, laid down
their arms. The officers were released, after pledging
themselves not to engage again in hostilities
against Prussia. The common soldiers were
placed at once in the Prussian army; but they were
of no service, as they deserted at the earliest opportunity.
The victory was followed by important
results. It was the majestic prelude to the later
battles of the Seven Years&rsquo; War.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Battle of Prague</span></h2>
<p>Frederick improved the winter of 1756
by increasing the strength of his army and
putting it in complete readiness for the
field; for it was evident that the enemy,
enraged at the glorious victory at Lobositz, would
put forth its utmost efforts to crush him. Emperor
Francis I,<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> upon the pretext that Frederick had
broken the peace by the invasion of Saxony, induced
the German imperial princes to place an army of sixty
thousand men in the field, designated the Reichs
Army. Frederick was confronted in all by half a
million fighting men, while he could only muster the
comparatively small force of about two hundred
thousand. The disparity was great, and any other
in his place would have been disheartened at once
at the prospect before him, but Frederick did not
waver or retreat. He relied upon his own indomitable
spirit, the strong attachment and devotion of
his officers, and above all upon his valiant, well-trained
soldiers, every one of whom would have
sacrificed his life for him. With such troops he
could well afford to risk battle with an enemy
greatly superior to him in numbers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Without unnecessary waste of time, Frederick
invaded Bohemia in the Spring of 1757. On the
first night of the march, he decided to lodge with a
peasant in a village near the frontier. Everything
requisite was sent on in advance, and a royal servant
notified the peasant that the King would sleep there
that night. When the time came, the peasant went to
his door to see the sovereign and his festive array.
After waiting for some time he saw a man in a blue
cloak, accompanied by two officers, dismount at his
door. He asked this person whether he was one
of the King&rsquo;s people; if so, he undoubtedly could
be accommodated by his neighbors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not in the service of the King,&rdquo; was the
reply of the man, who was none other than Frederick
himself, &ldquo;but he has invited me to supper
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is the case, be so good as to come in,
but brush off your boots, and clean up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Various other generals and adjutants shortly drove
up and saluted the King. The peasant, not knowing
what to make of it, became alarmed and retreated
into a corner. The King noticed his movement
and said, &ldquo;Stay here, sir, until the King arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>At last the peasant began to smile in a shame-faced
way. &ldquo;I know well enough who you are,&rdquo; he
began. &ldquo;You think I am a fool. This gentleman
is the King himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frederick smiled, and then entered the hut with
some of his generals. The peasant thereupon came
forward, shaking his head doubtfully, and when he
had sufficiently regained composure, said to one of
the attendants: &ldquo;That is too simple a dress for the
King of Prussia. Surely that gentleman could not
oppress his peasants.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The next morning Frederick set off again in
search of the enemy, who was in position on the
heights around Prague. Before reaching that city,
he had to march through the Pascopol pass. By
way of precaution he sent one hundred and fifty
hussars ahead to ascertain if the way was strongly
guarded. Hearing a few shots, the hussars rode back
to the King and reported that all the approaches
to the city were securely defended by hussars and
<i>pandours</i> (Hungarian soldiers). Frederick, who
had already been informed to the contrary, sternly
rebuked the commanding officer, and gave his own
order, &ldquo;Hussars! follow me. March!&rdquo; They
speedily brought in twenty <i>pandours</i> and seven
hussars, who were found hiding in the bushes.
The pass was difficult to travel, but it was unprotected,
and on the same day the army got through
safely and soon reached Prague, where the attack
was to be made. The situation seemed favorable,
as pasture land of unusual verdure appeared to
stretch far in the distance; but Field-Marshal
Schwerin advised the King to be cautious, for the
meadow might be full of swamp-holes and bogs, in
which cavalry and cannon might easily be mired.
He also asked that his troops might have a short
rest after their long and weary march; but, once
having formed his plans, Frederick would listen to
no suggestion of change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I must attack the enemy
to-day, cost what it may. The fresher fish, the
better fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Field-Marshal, notwithstanding his dismal
forebodings, exclaimed: &ldquo;Well, then, the battle
must and shall be fought to-day. I will attack the
Austrians here or wherever else I find them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Frederick ordered the charge. Like the plunging
billows of the sea the cavalry, with Schwerin at
their head, hurled themselves upon the enemy; but
the result was just what the veteran Field-Marshal
had feared. Cannon and cavalry were hampered
in their movements by the swampy ground, and
while trying to extricate themselves were also exposed
to a murderous fire from the enemy&rsquo;s batteries
on the surrounding heights. Whole ranks of gallant
Prussians were mowed down. It seemed impossible
to fill the gaps, but at this juncture, Schwerin,
then seventy-three years of age, seized a standard
from a captain, and with the shout, &ldquo;On, children,
on, let those who are not cowards follow me!&rdquo;
rushed forward.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> The brave old hero, however,
had hardly gone ten paces when he fell, mangled
by four grapeshots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>General Manteuffel took the standard from the
hand of his dead friend and shouted, &ldquo;Avenge the
death of a great man! On, my children! Bravely
on!&rdquo; Nothing now could restrain the Prussians,
who were furious with rage at the death of Schwerin.
Notwithstanding the storm of fire which cruelly
devastated their ranks, they heeded neither wounds
nor death. They scaled the heights and deluged
them with the enemy&rsquo;s blood. Frederick himself
quickly ended the battle. He observed a gap in
the enemy&rsquo;s centre, rushed in with three battalions,
and held his position in the very thick of the fight.
His soldiers fought like lions, and soon the victory
was won. But at what a cost! Eighteen thousand
brave Prussians were lying dead or wounded on the
field, without counting the noble Schwerin, &ldquo;who
alone,&rdquo; as Frederick said, &ldquo;was worth an army of
ten thousand men.&rdquo; Such was the battle of Prague
(May 6, 1757), one of the bloodiest struggles in the
Seven Years&rsquo; War.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Fredrick&rsquo;s Defeat and Seydlitz&rsquo;s Surprise</span></h2>
<p>The Austrians fled into the city of Prague,
which was closely invested by the Prussians
and bombarded with red-hot shot.
The people suffered greatly, and the
prospect of approaching famine compelled them to
make many sacrifices. The Austrian army had
about given up everything for lost and was on the
point of capitulating, when news reached them that
Field-Marshal Daun, with a strong force of sixty-six
thousand men, was on the way to their relief. Frederick
marched out to meet him with thirty-two thousand
men, the very flower of his army, hoping with
this comparatively small force to check his advance.
The two armies speedily met, and a battle began at
Kollin. At the outset fortune favored the Prussians.
The hussars cut their way through the enemy&rsquo;s lines
so furiously that Daun was on the point of retreating.
At this juncture, however, the King decided, in the
very midst of the battle, to change his excellent
original plan. Prince Moritz of Dessau and several
other generals differed from him, and when at last
he announced his decision, they refused to obey, for
they foresaw it must lead to disaster. Drawing his
sword for the first time, he rushed up to them,
sternly reminded them of their duty, and ordered
them back to their commands. The result was mismanagement
and confusion in handling the troops.
The Austrians and Saxons took advantage of this,
and rushed into the gaps&mdash;for the Prussians were no
longer in solid columns&mdash;and soon were the victors.
The latter left fourteen thousand dead and wounded
on the field. The remainder made an orderly retreat,
and Daun did not venture to pursue them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Bitterly disappointed, Frederick raised the siege
of Prague and fell back with his shattered army to
N&uuml;rnberg. They were obliged to dismount many
times on the way to water the horses, and on one
of these occasions an old trooper brought Frederick
a refreshing draught of water in his steel cap, and
handing it to him, said in the heartiest way, &ldquo;Drink,
Your Majesty, and let battles be battles. You are
living&mdash;that is good. The Almighty also lives,
and He will give us victory again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King looked at him and replied with a quiet
smile: &ldquo;Do you really think so, old fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The trooper nodded assent, and soon they were
on the march again. The King was in an unusually
gloomy mood, and at such times no one ventured
to disturb him. When they reached N&uuml;rnberg he
went off by himself without saying a word to anyone,
and sat down upon an old waste-pipe, where
he remained some time in deep thought, scratching
curious figures in the sand with a stick. Observing
this, his officers stepped more quietly and watched
him with much curiosity. Suddenly he rose and
said to those about him, &ldquo;Gentlemen, it is time for
action. We must not loiter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without showing any sign of his great disappointment
over his defeat, he issued the necessary commands,
and his aides were at once busy in distributing
them. Even the appearance of his splendid guard,
which had been so sorely treated at Kollin that out
of a thousand men only two hundred were unharmed
in the fight, did not disturb his composure
in the least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children,&rdquo; he said with much feeling, &ldquo;you
have had a hard day. But have patience, dear
friends; I will make it all right yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The King&rsquo;s enemies were joyful over the news of
his defeat at Kollin, and decided it would be wise to
attack him on all sides. In the east the Russians
invaded Prussia with one hundred thousand men.
The Swedes, to prove their bravery, attacked Pomerania,
but were driven back by General Belling.
General Lehwald, however, was less fortunate in his
operations against the Russians, as he had an army
of only thirty-two thousand men. He was overpowered
in an engagement at Grossj&auml;gerndorf and
compelled to retreat. The Russians might easily
have advanced to Brandenburg had they followed
up their advantage, but their General Apraxin fell
back still nearer the eastern Prussian frontier. This
extraordinary movement can only be explained in
one way. Apraxin had received express orders from
the warlike Empress Elizabeth to press operations
with vigor, but he had also been instructed by Grand
Duke Peter to go slow and take matters easily, for
he much preferred to have Frederick a good neighbor
in the future than an enemy.</p>
<p>Thus the King&rsquo;s lucky star shone brightly when
everything was darkest. He also received gratifying
assurances of love and devotion from his own
people. In Pomerania and Brandenburg they vied
with each other in making good the losses of men
and horses at Kollin. Frederick would have been
delighted with these assurances had not fresh troubles
overtaken him. His sorrow over the tragedy
at Kollin was followed by bitter grief, occasioned by
the death of a brother and his beloved mother.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
His great sorrow, as well as his greatness of soul, is
shown in his letters of that time, one of which closes
with the words, &ldquo;But I, threatened with the storm,
and notwithstanding the approaching ruin, must act,
live, and die as a King.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The French, meanwhile, who had crossed the
Rhine and invaded Westphalia, one hundred thousand
strong, were giving the King much trouble. His
Anglo-German auxiliary army, led by the Duke of
Cumberland, and much weaker than the French,
had been utterly defeated by them at Hastenbeck
on the Weser.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> The French now swarmed over
Hesse, Hanover, Brunswick, and Westphalia, and
destruction and ruin attended them wherever they
appeared; for it had been decided in Paris to devastate
Prussia and all the provinces which had
remained faithful to the King. The French army,
which at the beginning operated in two divisions,
was now united with the imperial troops for the
purpose of attacking Saxony, which was held by
Frederick. The French afterward divided again,
at Erfurt, into two bands, one of which under
Prince Soubise levied contributions on Gotha and
Weimar, while the other, under Marshal d&rsquo;Estr&eacute;es,
levied still heavier contributions upon the city of
Halle. From this point, one division of troops,
led by the Duke of Ayer, pressed forward to Halberstadt
and made inroads even as far as Magdeburg.
Those were troublous times for the old mark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Frederick, who was in upper Lusatia, was informed
of the threatening operations of the enemy. He
hastened forward by forced marches, strengthened
his army by the corps of ten thousand men at Dresden
under Prince Moritz, and with his comparatively
small force advanced to the Saale by way of Grimma
and Pegau. Bold General Seydlitz was in the
advance with a thousand dragoons to clear the region
of roving marauders. His brave troopers on September
7 appeared before Pegau, but found the
gate on the farther side of the stone Elster bridge
blocked and held by a large force of the enemy.
Seydlitz had no infantry, but he ordered a hundred
of his dragoons, for whom no horse was too wild,
no ditch too wide, and who were splendidly trained,
to dismount. They did so and stormed the gate,
and then, carbines in hand, the troop drove the
enemy at a gallop through the city. Seydlitz observed
an Austrian hussar regiment in battle-order
on the other side of the city. Although greatly
outnumbered, without an instant&rsquo;s delay he dashed
through their closed ranks with such fury that he
captured three hundred and fifty of them and hotly
pursued the others. The flying enemy attempted
to make a stand on the bridge at K&ouml;sen and attack
Seydlitz, but they were quickly dispersed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Meanwhile Soubise and his French generals were
occupying the castle at Gotha, and living there in
luxurious style. His eight thousand troops were
quartered in the market-place and other sections
of the city and living upon the best of the land
at the land&rsquo;s expense. Seydlitz, who was aware of
this, decided to arrange a little surprise for them
with the help of his merry troopers. Soubise and
his generals were entertaining some foreign guests
at an entertainment, for which extraordinary preparations
had been made. The tables were loaded
with the choicest viands, and costly wines flowed in
streams. The guests were greatly enjoying the
superb banquet, the charm of which was heightened
by the presence of beautiful ladies, when suddenly
Seydlitz and his hussars appeared at the gate.
Everything was in confusion at once. The officers
hurriedly left the festive scene, donned their gayly
plumed hats, rushed out of the hall pell-mell, and
fled in a panic. It never occurred to anyone,
though they were eight thousand strong, to offer
the slightest resistance to the little Prussian band.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Seydlitz, who could not think of making an effective
pursuit with his few worn-out soldiers, contented
himself with a short chase of the French.
Covered with dust and sprinkled with foam after the
sudden bold rush into the city, he and his officers
laughed heartily at the deserted tables decked out
so lavishly for the enemy. With lively jokes and
many a rollicking troopers&rsquo; song, the bold heroes
refreshed themselves with the choice dishes and
wines the duke&rsquo;s cooks had provided so lavishly,
and passed the hours of the afternoon and night in
the most hilarious and satisfied manner. An eyewitness
says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few French soldiers were taken prisoners,
but an army of servants, lackeys, cooks, hairdressers,
actors, and chambermaids, chests full of
perfumes and pomades, powder-boxes and hair-nets,
parasols and dressing-gowns, as well as a mass of
those knick-knacks which are indispensable to
French elegance, fell into the hands of the troopers,
who examined their plunder with astonishment and
fared royally upon the delicacies and wines found
among the equipages and cooks&rsquo; wagons, which
Seydlitz turned over to his troopers. The other
stuff he sent on to the French the next day free of
charge, as Prussian troopers had no use for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Frederick, in the meantime, with his little army,
about twenty-two thousand strong, had reached
Erfurt, by way of Grimma and Naumburg, where
he learned from Seydlitz that the fugitive enemy
were occupying a strong position at Eisenach.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a>
The situation was so uncertain that he decided not
to venture far from Saxony and the Elbe. Believing
that in his position he could resist the French
advance, he sent Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick
with four thousand men to Halberstadt to rid its
people of the enemy&rsquo;s exactions, and Prince Moritz
of Dessau with eight thousand men into the region
between the Mulde and Elbe to watch the movements
of the Austrians. When he heard of the
departure of these forces Soubise&rsquo;s courage revived.
He decided to advance and regain his former position.
He also plucked up courage to place himself
at the head of his army. With his strong force of
eight thousand men he approached Gotha. As
soon as Seydlitz, who had been re&euml;nforced by about
fifteen thousand men, noticed this move of the
enemy, he fell back, and pretended to seek shelter
in a ravine. He ordered his troopers to dismount,
fasten their sabres to their carbines, and spread
themselves out in a long line near their horses.
Thus extended, with the hussars in front and the
dragoons dismounted and in position on the hillside,
they presented from a distance the appearance
of long lines of infantry. The French, believing
the entire Prussian army was in front of them, fled
precipitately. Seydlitz&rsquo;s troopers pursued them,
and captured three officers and one hundred and fifty
men. Truly the Prussians had no reason to fear
such an enemy! As a result of the ruse, the
French did not stop running until they were far
away from Gotha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>About this time the Austrian general Haddick
made a descent upon Berlin and levied a considerable
war contribution, beside making a demand for
twenty-four pairs of fine gloves, which he intended
to present to his Empress. He obtained all that
he demanded, including the gloves; but the Berliners
showed a fine sense of humor in the trick
they played upon him&mdash;for on his return home he
learned that they were all for the left hand! Frederick,
who received the news of the descent when
it was too late to prevent it, decided at least to cut
off Haddick&rsquo;s return, and advanced with four thousand
men to the Elbe, leaving Field-Marshal
Keith, with five thousand men, to guard the Saale.
Other divisions were sent to Weissenfels and
Merseburg. After the King&rsquo;s withdrawal from
Thuringia, the French and the imperial troops also
abandoned their position at Gotha, and advanced
to Merseburg and Leipsic with the intention of
occupying Saxony. Keith, in the meantime, however,
had notified the King of the approach of the
enemy, who, recognizing the danger, at once turned,
drove the French before him, and made a halt
between Weissenfels and Merseburg. This position,
however, was insecure, for the greatly superior
enemy was bent upon surrounding and capturing
the King&rsquo;s little force. Indeed, Soubise carried his
audacity so far that he sent word to his King that
Frederick could no longer escape him and that he
expected soon to have the honor of bringing him a
prisoner to Paris. How bitterly he was deceived!</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">The Brilliant Victory at Rossbach</span></h2>
<p>Frederick encountered the enemy at
Rossbach,<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> November 5, 1757. He could
only oppose twenty-two thousand men to
an army over sixty thousand strong. The
disparity was great, but he relied upon his good
fortune and the bravery of his soldiers. As was his
invariable custom upon critical occasions, he sought
to inspire his troops with words of encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hour has come,&rdquo; he said to them, &ldquo;when
all that is sacred to us depends upon our bravery.
You know that I have shared fatigue, hunger, cold,
night-watches, and dangers with you, and you know
that I am ready to sacrifice my life with you and for
you. All I ask in return is the same trust and
good-will. Act now like men, and trust in God.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>The King&rsquo;s simple words made a deep impression.
His soldiers answered with an enthusiastic shout.
&ldquo;We will die with you!&rdquo; exclaimed the grizzled
warriors, while tears rolled down their powder-stained
cheeks. The King was deeply moved by
these expressions of love and devotion. He had
chosen an elevated spot for his camp. The enemy
was exultant, for they believed it an easy task to capture
the little army, and they hastened to surround
the site where it was camped so as to cut off escape
in every direction. Frederick&rsquo;s sharp eyes watched
their movements, but they did not appear to trouble
him. On the other hand, he ordered his soldiers
to eat their dinner, he and his generals at the same
time sitting at open table. The French could not
conceal their surprise at such recklessness. They
were sure he was ignorant of his inevitable fate.
They were not aware it was only a trick, for while
part of the soldiers were eating, the others were
getting the horses in order and artillery and ammunition
in readiness. When all the preparations
were made, and the King believed the right moment
had come, the tents disappeared in a trice and
the Prussians stood in marching order, ready for
the attack. Before it began, the King noticed
M&ouml;ller, an artillery colonel, who was of great service
to him in field operations, and who at all critical
times, when his advice was asked, invariably
said, &ldquo;Believe me, Your Majesty, my guardian
angel says it will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>M&ouml;ller had been assigned a very important position.
The King had ordered his guns placed so
that they were invisible to the enemy, and had
hopes of good results from them. He hastened up
to him, and placing his hand familiarly upon his
shoulder, said, &ldquo;Well, M&ouml;ller, what does your
guardian angel say this time? Is everything all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Your Majesty,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;My
angel promises victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At it, then, in God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; answered Frederick,
and at his signal the battle began. The artillery
poured a terrible rain of shot into the French ranks,
and the infantry accompanied the crashes of cannon
with such a din of musketry that the French were
taken completely by surprise. They had not recovered
from it when General Seydlitz, hurling
his pipe into the air and shouting &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; gave
the signal to his troopers to charge. Impetuously
they dashed out from behind the hill, and hurled
themselves upon the French like a thunderbolt,
riding down and sabring everyone in their way.
The panic-stricken enemy could offer no resistance.
All who could, fled to escape destruction. The
battle of Rossbach from that time on was simply a
wild hunt. They threw away everything that might
impede their flight. Cavalrymen dismounted, took
off their great boots, and unbuckled their sabres.
Whole battalions were taken prisoners by a few
hussars without making any resistance, while others
hid among the bushes or branches of trees. Few
of them stopped until the Rhine was behind them.
In short, it was a spectacle the like of which the
world had rarely seen before. The attack began
at two o&rsquo;clock, and at nightfall not a Frenchman
was to be seen. Two thousand of the enemy were
left upon the field and seven thousand were captured
Sixty-three cannon and twenty-three standards
were also taken. The Prussians lost only
ninety-one. All Germany was jubilant over the
victory, for the French had made themselves bitterly
hated by their outrages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Immediately after the battle, the heroic King led
his brave troops into Silesia, where the Austrians
were once more active, having taken Breslau and
Schweidnitz, and confident they would become
masters of the whole province. In about a fortnight
the Prussians reached the Oder. On the
march thither, a fortunate event occurred. As the
Austrians, four thousand strong, were taking the garrison
of Schweidnitz to a place of imprisonment, the
latter heard of the great victory their beloved King
had won at Rossbach. Aroused by the news, they
fell upon their guards and cut them down, and
regained their freedom. Uncertain where they were
going, they by chance met the King&rsquo;s army, of whose
movements they were ignorant. Frederick, as delighted
as he was surprised, cordially greeted them,
and all considered the happy incident as a good
omen for the future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frederick at Leuthen and Lissa</span></h2>
<p>The main army of the Austrians, eighty
thousand strong, held a position in the
vicinity of Leuthen, between Breslau and
Neumarkt. When its commander, Prince
Carl of Lothringen, heard that the King was near
by with thirty-six thousand men, he remarked, &ldquo;That
must be the Berlin guard parade.&rdquo; Frederick did not
wait long. Regardless of the disparity between the
two forces, he determined to measure strength with
the Austrians, cost what it might. Under a gloomy,
gray December sky, the King one day summoned
his generals and thus addressed them:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;In violation of all the rules of the art of war, I
propose to attack this army of Prince Carl though
it is thrice as strong as ours. It is not a question
of the numbers of the enemy nor of the strength
of his position. I hope we shall overcome these
odds by the valor of our troops, and by strictly
carrying out my plans. I must risk this action or
all will be lost. We must beat the enemy or all of
us must perish before his batteries. So I think, so
I shall act. Make my decision known to the army.
Get it in readiness for the work soon to come. As
for the rest, when you remember you are Prussians,
you will certainly prove yourselves worthy of the
name. But if there be any among you who fear to
share danger with me, he can have his discharge
this evening without exposing himself to the slightest
reproach from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King regarded his veterans questioningly.
One of them came forward and said: &ldquo;He is a
knave who would retire or fear to offer his life for
his Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure,&rdquo; resumed the King, &ldquo;none of you
would desert me. With your faithful aid, victory will
be certain. Should I fall and thus be prevented
from rewarding you for your service, the Fatherland
will do it. Now go to your commands and give
them this message: The regiment of cavalry which
does not attack the enemy the instant it is ordered,
shall be unhorsed after the battle and made a garrison
regiment. The regiment of infantry which
under any circumstances hesitates in the least, shall
lose its colors and arms, and I will cut the decorations
from the uniforms. Now, good-bye, gentlemen.
We shall soon defeat the enemy or never
see each other again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Both officers and soldiers were deeply impressed
by the King&rsquo;s words, and all awaited the battle of
the following day with eager expectation. The
soldiers were so enthusiastic that they sang sacred
hymns to the accompaniment of the field bands.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>
As singing before battle had not previously been
customary, one of the generals asked the King if he
should not order the soldiers to be silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied the King. &ldquo;With such men as
these, God certainly will give us the victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Prussians approached Leuthen, the King
was informed that the enemy&rsquo;s force was as strong
again as his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; answered the dauntless hero, &ldquo;but
there is only one way out of it&mdash;conquer or perish.
I would attack them even were they on the Zobtenberg.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>&rdquo;
Before giving the signal for the attack,
Frederick called a hussar officer with fifty men to
him and said: &ldquo;I shall expose myself in battle to-day
more than usual. You and your fifty men are
to serve as my bodyguard. You must not leave
me, and you must see to it that I do not fall into
the hands of the canaille. If I am killed, cover
my body with my cloak, place it in a wagon, and
say not a word about it. Let the battle continue
and the enemy will be beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>About this time the right wing of the cavalry,
commanded by Prince Moritz of Dessau, halted at
a churchyard, where the Austrians had planted one
of their strongest batteries and were firing from
time to time upon the skirmishers, sometimes with
serious effect. To save them from this fire, Prince
Moritz ordered them to fall back; but Frederick,
when he noticed the movement, rushed up and
cried: &ldquo;Not yet! not yet! Those are only alarm
shots. Children,&rdquo; turning to the skirmishers,
&ldquo;follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They promptly obeyed the King, who led them
back to their former position and said: &ldquo;Stay here.
Have no fear. I will send help to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While saying this, the enemy&rsquo;s cannonading was
kept up. Prince Moritz said to the King: &ldquo;It is
too dangerous for you here, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; replied Frederick, with the
utmost composure, &ldquo;but I shall soon drive the
Austrians back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The King made good his promise. The battle
began between one and two o&rsquo;clock, on the fifth
of December, 1757. The enemy&rsquo;s line of battle
stretched a mile, but Frederick was not alarmed.
His main attack was directed against the left wing,
and at this point the enemy&rsquo;s line was completely
broken. A like fate overtook the right wing, which
was simultaneously attacked. The enemy&rsquo;s centre
finally gave way, and before dark the King was
master of the field. The sanguinary struggle lasted
only three hours, but it was one of the most brilliant
of his victories. Twenty thousand prisoners fell
into the hands of the Prussians, and beside these
they captured one hundred and thirty-four cannon
and fifty-nine standards. Frederick rewarded
Prince Moritz on the field for his service. Drawing
rein, he said to him, &ldquo;I congratulate you upon
the victory, Herr Field-Marshal&rdquo;&mdash;with these
words elevating him to that high position. The
exhausted troops camped that night on the battlefield.
It was a weird spectacle. All around them
were the bodies left by the defeated Austrians, and
the groans of the wounded made dreary night
music. Suddenly an old grenadier loudly and jubilantly
sang &ldquo;Nun danket alle Gott.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> This hymn
of joy voiced the feelings of the soldiers, and when
the bands struck up, the whole army joined in the
uplifting song of thanksgiving. The effect was indescribable.
The religious sentiment in the camp
was unmistakable. Everyone had awaited the day
with eager expectation. They had faced death in
a thousand shapes, and terrible was the remembrance
which it left. The pious soldiers passed a
sleepless night, and left the field of victory with the
proud consciousness that they had added new
laurels to their heroic King&rsquo;s wreath of fame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>While in pursuit of the enemy, Frederick with a
little band of soldiers approached Lissa. Before arriving
he learned that it swarmed with Austrians.
The King ordered a halt, reined up his horse, and
sent one of his aides back with instructions to
bring up the Manteuffel and Wedell battalions of
grenadiers, which had been left behind at the last
moment, and to say to them that he was so well
satisfied with their bravery, they should spend the
night with him at his headquarters in Lissa, and
every man beside should have a thaler. It was a
good half-hour before the two battalions came up,
and when they did he placed himself at their head
and boldly rode into Lissa, where everything was
quiet, although lights were seen in the houses on
all sides. As the King, who appeared familiar with
the place, rode into the spacious plaza near the
castle, and about sixty paces from the bridge across
the Schweidnitz, he noticed white-coats coming out
of several of the houses with straw on their backs.
Most of them were caught by the Prussian grenadiers,
and some were brought before the King.
When asked what they were doing, one of them
replied:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;A captain holds the other end of the bridge
with one hundred and fifty men. He was ordered
to strew the bridge with straw and set it afire as
soon as the Prussians approached. So many townspeople
have crossed, however, that the straw was
trampled down in the mud and mire, and the
captain threw it into the water and sent forty men
to the stables to fetch fresh straw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the white-coats in the meantime had
stolen away and notified the captain of the arrival
of the Prussians, and while the King was talking
with the prisoners he opened a brisk fire, by which
some of the grenadiers in the rear of the King were
wounded. Great confusion followed. The artillerists
cried, &ldquo;Back! back! we are fired upon!&rdquo; Those
on horseback rode near the houses, so as not to
expose themselves to the fire of friend and enemy
in the windows. The Prussian artillery opened fire
at once, and the grenadiers also joined in. The
entire city was in alarm. The Prussians were exposed
to a brisk fire from the houses, to which they
promptly replied. The tumult was great, and shouts
and commands were confusedly mixed. The King,
however, remarked with the utmost composure:
&ldquo;Gentlemen, follow me. I am no stranger here.&rdquo;
Thereupon he rode to the left over the drawbridge
leading to the castle, followed by a few of his officers.
He had hardly arrived at the castle entrance when
several Austrian officers and attendants, with lanterns
in their hands, ran down the steps and made an
effort to get to their horses in the castle yard and
escape under cover of the darkness. The King,
dismounting, quietly confronted them and said:
&ldquo;Good-evening, gentlemen. Evidently you were
not expecting me. Is there no room left for me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>It would have been easy for them to have overpowered
Frederick if they had had the courage, but
the suddenness of his appearance and the confident
tone of his voice so completely dazed them that
they took the lanterns from the hands of their
attendants, lit the King up the stairs, and escorted
him to one of the finest of the rooms. The most
distinguished of the Austrian officers introduced his
comrades to the King, by name and rank, and all
joined in agreeable conversation. During this time
more Prussian officers arrived at the castle, fearing
the King might be in danger; but they found him
enjoying himself mightily. He finally took leave
of the Austrian officers, however, and they sought
quarters in other rooms of the spacious castle.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p3.jpg" alt="" width="653" height="800" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>Good evening, gentlemen, evidently you were not expecting me</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>That same night the King&rsquo;s entire army arrived
at Lissa, having been ordered there by mistake. By
this time the Prussians had taken a great number of
prisoners. Zieten scoured the neighborhood with
his hussars, and drove the fugitives even into Bohemia,
and pressed the enemy so closely that out of
eighty thousand men only about seventeen thousand
reached the Bohemian frontier. The King
followed, and soon overtook Zieten by a shorter
route.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Siege of Olm&uuml;tz</span></h2>
<p>The year 1757, which had been so abundant
in Prussian victories, drew to its
close. Without remaining longer in Bohemia,
the King made a forced march
into Silesia,&mdash;where several cities and strongholds
had again fallen into the enemy&rsquo;s hands,&mdash;not alone
to drive the enemy out at that unfavorable season,
but for the more important purpose of seeking
winter quarters. As the Prussians were continually
harassed on the march by the enemy&rsquo;s skirmishers,
the King ordered night marches, so as to ensure the
security of the sutlers&rsquo; stores and baggage from the
marauders. After marching all night, the army
would halt at daybreak, the cavalry dismount, and
the infantry sleep as much as possible under the
circumstances. One morning the King, after dismounting,
said: &ldquo;How nice it would be if we had
some schnapps!&rdquo; Several, who had bread and
brandy, rushed up to him and offered him their little
store.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The King smiled with genuine satisfaction at
the generosity and self-sacrificing spirit of his
soldiers, and said: &ldquo;Children, if I could drink
brandy I would take it with pleasure. But I thank
you for your love, and will not forget this day
which has been such a happy one for us all.&rdquo;
Then he turned to his staff, and said: &ldquo;There is
no happier King in the world than I.&rdquo; He ordered
Lieutenant-Colonel Von Wacknitz to make a list
of his guards, and at Breslau a <i>Friedrich
d&rsquo;or</i><a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> was
given to each man. Notwithstanding these fatiguing
marches, the King found his soldiers so eager for
active duty that he decided to take advantage of
their enthusiasm and attack the enemy without
delay. Breslau, with its strong garrison of sixteen
thousand men, surrendered, and this placed the
King once more in possession of all Silesia except
Schweidnitz. He now permitted his brave troops
to go into winter quarters, as they so well deserved,
while he spent the Winter in Breslau.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>With the first approach of Spring the King was on
the alert. When all was in readiness for moving,
he mustered his guard on the Schweidnitz meadows.
As they were assembling he noticed a seven-year-old
lad who was actively engaged in drilling a dozen
other boys, who had sticks for horses. The King
laughed at the sport, and after watching them a little
while, said: &ldquo;That boy will be a good soldier some
day.&rdquo; The next time he observed him, he saw that
the little leader had exerted himself so vigorously
in making an attack that he was bleeding profusely
from the nose. The boy, however, mounted his
stick again and renewed the attack with vigor.
The King called to him: &ldquo;My child, go home and
wash off the blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy replied with much dignity: &ldquo;Oh, no!
that won&rsquo;t do, for it will throw everything into disorder.
I am not yet killed; I am only wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King in surprise asked, &ldquo;What is your
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kneuschke,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? And what does your father do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a gardener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King made a note of it, and thenceforward
paid the gardener five thalers a month, to be applied
toward his son&rsquo;s education.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Satisfactory as everything appeared, Frederick
was not unmindful of the dangers to which he was
exposed. He would have been willing to make
terms of peace if this had been satisfactory, but his
haughty enemies did not stop to consider what serious
losses their far abler adversary could inflict
upon them, even with a smaller force. The more
victories he won, the more implacable was their
animosity toward him, and the more firmly convinced
were they that sooner or later they would
crush him; for they were sure that he could not
hold out long against their united strength, and
that in the end he would have to abandon the
struggle from mere exhaustion. The King seems
to have divined their schemes. About this time he
wrote to a friend:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to this alliance against the
Margrave of Brandenburg? What would the great
Elector have said if he had known that his grandson
would have been fighting Russians, Austrians,
nearly all Germany, and a hundred thousand Frenchmen?
I do not know whether I am strong enough
to withstand them and whether it would be a disgrace
for me to submit, but I am certain that my
enemies will gain no honor from my defeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a careful survey of the situation, the King
decided it would not be incompatible with honor to
offer terms of peace to his enemies. They regarded
the offer as a sign of weakness, rejected it, and entered
upon a fresh campaign of even more active
hostility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Frederick did not hesitate. He rallied all his
strength, repaired the losses incurred in previous
battles, and confronted the powerful enemy with a
splendidly equipped army. Unfortunate Saxony,
which was completely in his hands, had to contribute
a large sum of money, as well as clothing and recruits.
Unexpected help also came from another quarter.
The battle of Rossbach had aroused great enthusiasm
in Europe, particularly in England, where
there was strong sympathy with Prussia. Parliament
unanimously voted to assist its brave ally.
It sent him twelve thousand men, placed the Hanoverian
army, which was in excellent condition, at
his disposal, and united it with the forces from
Hesse, Brunswick, and Gotha, making an army
thirty thousand strong. This fresh body of troops,
after such severe losses as he had met, was a welcome
gift to the King. Parliament also promised to send
four million thalers,<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> with the understanding that an
able leader should be selected for the new corps.
It could not have sent more acceptable help, for the
King needed money as well as men at this time,
when the war was about to be resumed with renewed
vigor on all sides. Necessity forced him to make
from ten to twelve millions of debased coin out of
his four million thalers, as he had no other way of
meeting his war expenses. He appointed Duke
Ferdinand of Brunswick, who was universally regarded
as a superior soldier, in command of the
thirty thousand. Like the King, he, too, understood
how to oppose a large army with a smaller
one. Indeed, he was an expert in that direction.
He drove the French, who had overrun West Germany,
across the Rhine, inflicted heavy losses upon
them in their retreat, and captured eleven thousand
prisoners. Not satisfied with this achievement, he
kept control of the river, and fought a battle with
the French, June 23, at Crefeld, in which they were
routed. Seven thousand more prisoners fell into
his hands and hundreds of bodies covered the battlefield.
Notwithstanding these disasters, the French
a little later made another attempt to invade Germany,
which was thwarted in such a masterly manner
that at the close of the year they were content to
stay on their own side of the German river. The
Duke then made his headquarters in Munster and
from there held the enemy in check.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>While Duke Ferdinand was thus disposing of the
French in the west, the King decided to attack the
strong fortress at Schweidnitz, the only one remaining
in the hands of the Austrians. On the march
thither, while riding through a narrow defile, he
found the artillery badly tangled up. While rushing
about to hasten movements, he ran against a
wheel and split one of his boots so badly that he
could hardly keep it on. Impatient at the accident,
he ordered an aide to find a shoemaker who could
stitch up the boot. After considerable search a
dragoon was found, who came, bringing his tools
with him. The King, dismounting, and seating
himself upon a hillock, said: &ldquo;Can you mend my
boot?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will see, Your Majesty. I have mended a
good many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hurry up, so that I can go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dragoon began work, at the same time
growling to himself: &ldquo;Hm! These boots have
done service enough to warrant a new pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that you are saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think your boots have honestly done
all the service they can. It is no wonder they rip.
They are worn out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? How long think you boots must last?&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Must</i> last&mdash;that is a different thing; but I
can easily tell you how long they <i>can</i> last&mdash;three
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old fool, they are not as old as that yet. But
tell me how a shoemaker can be a good dragoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have seen how, at Hohenfriedsberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I was, and I have soled Austrians
so that many of them will remember me for a long
time. When I make shoes, I am a shoemaker;
and when I ride a horse, I am a dragoon&mdash;and
Heaven help those who get into my hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gently, gently, Mr. Shoemaker, I am in your
hands. Be merciful with me.&rdquo; When the dragoon
had finished, the King swiftly rode forward, placed
himself at the head of his troops, and the march was
resumed.</p>
<p>Frederick&rsquo;s fortunate victory so discouraged the
Austrian troops that the Schweidnitz garrison,
although amply provisioned, made but a feeble
resistance, and surrendered in a few days at discretion.
All Silesia was once more in possession of
the King. To make Maria Theresa appreciate his
strength he extended the area of his operations into
Moravia and laid siege to the city of Olm&uuml;tz, a
suburb, as it were, of Vienna. It was an undertaking,
however, as fruitless as it was unfortunate.
The siege was long protracted, for the besiegers
were not only hampered by lack of sufficient artillery,
but of ammunition, which had to be hauled over
morasses and through deep defiles. In consequence,
the King had plenty of leisure for excursions
into the neighboring country. Upon one
of these occasions he rode about the country of
Glatz in company with General Seydlitz. Passing
through a defile, the King noticed, some distance
away, a collection of people, whom at first glance he
took to be a detachment of Austrians. Seydlitz,
who had unusually sharp eyes, was of opinion that
Fouquet had fixed his limits there and stationed
these people so that the enemy&rsquo;s troops could not
cross them without his knowledge. The King and
Seydlitz rode up and found that the people were
peasants of the country, whom Fouquet had placed
there to watch the line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Prussians?&rdquo; asked Frederick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;we are Fickets.&rdquo; (Fouquet
was called &ldquo;Ficket&rdquo; by the common people.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see now,&rdquo; said the King to Seydlitz,
laughing, &ldquo;who is master here, and that I don&rsquo;t
count for much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, the King continued riding
about the country, and one day made a discovery
which disturbed him not a little. He heard that
the Countess Gr&uuml;n, wife of a staff officer of the
garrison, had made a vow to the Virgin, at the
Jesuit church, that she would present her a beautiful
robe when the siege of Olm&uuml;tz was raised.
He immediately ordered a robe made of the richest
material for the Madonna, and sent it to the Jesuits
with the message that as he had heard of the Countess&rsquo;s
useless vow, and as he was as mindful of the
amenities of life as she, he did not wish our dear
Lady should be the loser. As events might take
another turn, he was simply carrying out what the
Countess might not be able to perform. The
Jesuits, delighted with his gift, came in procession
to thank him, and exhibited the robe to strangers as
a proof of the King&rsquo;s pious sentiments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>The King at this time evidently intended to
press the siege with vigor and capture Olm&uuml;tz.
The Austrians by themselves would not have
troubled him, but he soon heard the unwelcome
news that the Russians had captured C&uuml;strin and
committed frightful excesses. He was, therefore,
forced to consider the raising of the siege. His
final decision was hastened by the information that
a detachment of the enemy had captured a convoy
of ammunition and supplies at Domst&auml;dt, which
had been sent him from Silesia. With extreme
reluctance he summoned all his generals and regiment
and battalion commanders to headquarters.
When they were all there, he advanced into their
midst and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, the enemy has found an opportunity
to destroy a convoy coming to us from Silesia.
Owing to this fatal blow, I must raise the siege of
Olm&uuml;tz, but, gentlemen, you must not conclude that
all is lost on that account. No, you may be sure
that everything will be made good, and in such a
way that the enemy will have something to think
about. You must persuade your commands not to
grumble about it. I hope you will not be disappointed
yourselves, and should I,&mdash;though I do not
expect it,&mdash;find that anyone else is, I shall punish
such an one severely. I shall move immediately, and
wherever I find the enemy I shall attack, however
he may be posted and whether he has one or several
batteries; but,&rdquo; tapping his brow with his stick, &ldquo;I
shall never do anything unreasonable or rash. I am
confident that every one of my officers and soldiers
will do their duty when the time comes, as they
have always done in the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s words had a marked effect upon his
generals. Frederick dismissed them with a cordial
handshake and that gracious and friendly manner
which captivated everyone. He parted from them
with their assurance that he could rely upon their
help under any circumstances. The siege was raised
and the retreat was a masterly exhibition of generalship.
It had to be made through Bohemia, as Field-Marshal
Daun occupied the road through Silesia.
Daun was taken by surprise. The hussars performed
excellent service by covering the retreat
through defiles and over mountains. The King
rode at the head of the cavalry day and night, so as
to be on the alert against surprise by the enemy.
Swamps and hollows were not looked upon as
obstacles. Artillery and cavalry were forced to find
some way over them. Once, in the darkness of the
night, the King, riding in front of the vanguard,
came to a steep descent, some four or five hundred
feet to the bottom. The skirmishers, with a Bohemian
peasant who served as guide, were some distance
in advance. For this reason the King, who
was anxious to lose no time and to take advantage
of the darkness, called a halt and notified the whole
army of the situation. The cavalry had to dismount
so as to reach the valley. One under officer who
was in the lead hesitated on the edge of the descent,
fearing that his horse would slip, and groped about
himself for a footing while all the others were ready
to go down. The King grew impatient over the
waste of time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must have even poorer eyes than I,&rdquo; he
said with some anger, &ldquo;for you stumble around like
a blind man. Come here and hold fast to my coat-tails
and I will get you down, and the army will not
be delayed any longer.&rdquo; The officer did as he was
bid and safely reached the bottom, like the others,
with no greater harm than a few bruises.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Seydlitz Saves the Day at Zorndorf</span></h2>
<p>Notwithstanding obstacles of the
kind related in the last chapter, which
were frequent in that region, the progress
of the army was not checked and Silesia
was reached. The King left the larger part of the
army at Landeshut with Field-Marshal Keith,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> for
the protection of Silesia, and pushed on by exhausting
marches under the scorching sun to the relief of
Count Dohna, who was in great danger from the
attacks of the Russians. The latter, leaving devastation
in their wake, had invaded Prussia as far as
C&uuml;strin, as already mentioned. This place they had
captured after great destruction, and they also forced
it to pay a heavy contribution in money. Trampled
fields and burning villages marked the route of the
northern barbarians. The unfortunate inhabitants
of cities and villages, driven from house and home,
wandered in bands, seeking shelter and help. Deeply
touched by the indescribable wretchedness of his
countrymen, Frederick marched all the more rapidly
until he came up with the Russians at Zorndorf.
A little stream alone separated the two armies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>As so much depended upon securing an accurate
idea of the whole situation, the exact position as
well as numbers of the enemy, the King, attended
by an aide, a servant who carried his spyglass, and
a groom, rode to the bank of the stream, dismounted
and bade his servant also alight. Resting his glass
upon the latter&rsquo;s shoulder, he began making observations.
The moment the Russians saw him, they
opened a continuous fire from the nearest battery,
the shot striking so near the King as to cover his
coat with dirt. He calmly continued his observations
without moving his glass or a change in the
expression of his face. At last his aide thought it
was his duty to remind him of the danger to which
he was exposed. He stepped up, gently pulled the
skirts of the King&rsquo;s coat, and said: &ldquo;Your Majesty
is in too great danger here. See how the shots are
striking all around you. Your coat and hat are
covered with dirt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>It was some little time before the King replied.
At last he turned to the aide, saying with the utmost
coolness: &ldquo;If you are afraid, you can ride back&rdquo;;
and then resumed his observations at once. After
he had seen all he wished, he said to his servant:
&ldquo;Now you can pack up.&rdquo; With these words he
mounted his horse and leisurely rode away under a
very shower of shot, talking in the meanwhile with his
aide on various matters, utterly indifferent to danger.</p>
<p>The ruin caused by the Russians so infuriated
the King that he decided upon a battle to the death,
and issued orders that none of the barbarous enemy
should be spared.</p>
<p>It was in the early morning of August 25, 1758,
that the Prussian army, thirty-two thousand strong,
confronted, in battle array, an enemy greatly exceeding
it in strength, for the Russians numbered fifty-two
thousand men. After all preparations for the
battle had been made, and as the Prussians were
marching out of camp, the King conversed with
officers and the rank-and-file upon various matters
as they passed by, with as much composure as if it
were a parade. He was somewhat surprised at an
old corporal in the grenadier battalion of the Berlin
garrison, named Beek, whose very bald head was
covered with the grenadier&rsquo;s cap while his wig was
hanging from his knapsack. The King rode up to
him and noticed that the old man was still very
active.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is high time somebody
looked after you. Have you had an education?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Your Majesty, I have learned nothing; I
can neither read nor write. I had to be a soldier
when I was very young, and I am of no use except
to be shot at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been in the service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-four years already, and yet I am perfectly
sound. If the war lasts long enough, however, my
time to die will come. I don&rsquo;t care for that, for I
have always lived the soldier&rsquo;s life. There is only
one thing that troubles me. If it were not for that,
Your Majesty, I shouldn&rsquo;t care if I were shot to-day.
I would die right willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King listened attentively and then asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what troubles you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty, I have an only boy who is making
some progress. His mother has taught him to
read quite well, and I would be glad to have him
learn whatever is proper for him, and go to some
good school, so that he will know more than I do.
That will help him when he goes out into the world,
I cannot afford to give him anything out of my
allowance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your son to be found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father gave him his son&rsquo;s residence, and told
his name, and then the King rode away. A few
minutes after this the battle began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The Russians were formed in a huge quadrilateral.
The Prussian artillery played havoc with this dense,
unwieldy mass, for Captain M&ouml;ller that day had
one hundred and seventeen cannon and howitzers.
Seydlitz was chief in command of all the cavalry.
The Russian general, Fermor, opened the battle
prematurely by a sudden attack with his cavalry,
which dashed upon the Prussians with loud cheers.
Seydlitz did not neglect his opportunity. With his
characteristic energy he repulsed the cavalry and
hurled back the enemy&rsquo;s infantry. The ensuing
confusion, greatly increased by the dust, smoke, and
furious battle cries, was so great that the Russian
rear guard fired upon their own men. Dreadful
slaughter followed, but the Russians stood as if
rooted to the earth and fought like lions. At last,
by the aid of invincible courage and judicious leadership,
the Prussian army weakened the enemy, but
as yet without decisive result. An eyewitness
describes the further progress of the battle as
follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fiercely blazed the noonday sun upon the
exhausted troops, who had been on their feet since
four o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The cavalry was particularly
fatigued, for it had been engaged at the
most dangerous points. Both men and animals
needed refreshment, which could only be procured
for a short time back of the village of Zorndorf,
where Seydlitz&rsquo;s squadrons had been stationed.
The King was anxious to make the battle decisive,
and therefore, in the afternoon, ordered it to be renewed.
The Russian army stood ready in battle
order. Fifteen thousand infantry, twelve ranks
deep, occupied a strong position, and one hundred
cannon covered their flanks and poured a deadly fire
into the approaching Prussian regiments. Their
onset was checked, and they fell back. The fate
of Prussia and its heroic King hung in the balance.
Seydlitz, who had formed his cavalry in three
divisions, recognized the danger and rushed forward.
He had his sixty-one squadrons in such shape
that they could make repeated assaults upon the
obstinate enemy. The first division was composed
of eighteen squadrons of cuirassiers, assisted by a
fine regiment of carbineers and a corps of <i>gens
d&rsquo;armes</i>. At a hundred yards away were three
regiments of dragoons in the second division, which
supported the first and filled up gaps. The third
division, two hundred and fifty yards distant, consisted
of three regiments of hussars, whose duty it
was to capture artillery, take charge of prisoners,
and destroy broken battalions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;In order to save the badly weakened men and
horses as much as possible, Seydlitz ordered that
at first all movements should be made in slow and
regular time; but at the final &lsquo;March, march,&rsquo;
they should not spare the spur, but hurl themselves
upon the enemy with all possible force and
fury. The powerful body began its slow movement,
greatly hindered by the retreating battalions
of Dohna&rsquo;s infantry. With clear, far-reaching voice
Seydlitz ordered, &lsquo;Make ready for attack!&rsquo; for the
Russian shots were already falling among them.
Quickly followed the first &lsquo;March, march,&rsquo; order,
blown by two hundred trumpeters, but the squadrons
moved forward at an easy gallop. Nearer and
nearer, enveloped in dense clouds of dust, they
rushed upon the Russian colossus. Then came
the thunder-shock. Grapeshot made frightful
havoc in the Prussian ranks. At last the trumpeters
sounded the final &lsquo;March, march,&rsquo; and with
all their force the Prussian centaurs hurled themselves
upon the enemy&rsquo;s bayonets. With incessant
and irresistible fury the whole sixty-one squadrons
repeatedly charged. The cannon were captured,
men were mowed down. Suddenly firing ceased.
Death came by cut and thrust. Darkness and the
complete exhaustion of men and horses ended the
slaughter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Frederick was jubilant over his brilliant victory.
One hundred and three cannon, twenty-seven standards,
and the money chests were the spoils of the
day, but ten thousand Prussians were left upon the
field of honor. On this day, Seydlitz and his
cavalry had rescued the Fatherland and saved
Prussia&rsquo;s military glory. He had performed miracles
of bravery, and when the infantry wavered it
was his cavalry which put the enemy to flight.
The King himself acknowledged this, for when
he was congratulated upon the great victory he
turned to Seydlitz, and said: &ldquo;But for this man
things would have looked bad for us by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frederick&rsquo;s Defeat at Hochkirch</span></h2>
<p>The King was in more cheerful humor
after the brilliant victory at Zorndorf.
The carrying out of his battle plans had
demanded all his physical and mental
ability, but he was not so absorbed in his victory
that he forgot his old soldier. Shortly after the
battle, he happened to meet Corporal Beek, who
had escaped unhurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the King to him with great cordiality,
&ldquo;your son is going to be looked after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beek soon learned that this was true. A messenger
who carried the news of the victory to Berlin,
when he returned, brought him a letter from his
wife, telling him that her son had been taken from
her by royal command and placed in the Gymnasium,
where he was to be clothed, maintained, and
educated at public expense. The old corporal wept
tears of joy on receiving the news, and blessed the
King who had such a fatherly interest in his soldiers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>A few days before the battle of Zorndorf a letter
from the Austrian Field-Marshal Daun fell into the
hands of the King.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> It warned the Russian commander
of the proposed attack, and added that he
ought not to go into battle with such a wily enemy,
but should cautiously man&oelig;uvre and hold him in
check until the Austrians could get possession of
Saxony. The letter disclosed the enemy&rsquo;s plans.
After the victory, the King wrote to Daun:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did well to warn the Russian general
against a wily enemy whom you know better than
he. He made a stand and has been defeated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>A bolt from the clear sky could not have alarmed
the Austrian field-marshal more than these words
from the much-feared King, and his alarm increased
when the rumor spread that he was approaching.
The report was true. The energetic hero hurried
forward as rapidly as the condition of his army
would permit, so as to reach Saxony and bring relief
to his brother, Prince Henry, who was hard-pressed
by the Austrians. His plan was to drive
the Austrians from Neisse, which had been besieged
by them for a long time; but Daun, as soon as he
was aware of Frederick&rsquo;s approach, withdrew in
alarm and entrenched himself in a strong position.
The King had no intention of attacking the enemy
in his stronghold. He paid not the slightest attention
to him, but as if in utter contempt took a
position right before his eyes at Hochkirch, where
on October 14, 1758, the battle occurred. The
King evidently carried his audacious plan too far.
He even allowed his enemy to go on entrenching
himself without once disturbing him. The day
before the sudden attack made by the Austrians he
observed that they were throwing up defenses upon
a mountain side, opposite one of the wings of his
army, as boldly and openly as if they expected
no interference. The Prussian general in command
of that wing sent an aide to the King&rsquo;s headquarters
with information of the enemy&rsquo;s operations. The
King said to the aide:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good news bring you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aide expressed his misgivings, and asked if
his Majesty would order them to open fire on the
enemy. The commander of the nearest battery
had assured them the enemy was in range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the King, &ldquo;pay no attention
to them. I shall catch them in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took his leave, but just as he was going out
the King called him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! Have you any idea what a cannon-shot
might cost me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The question surprised the aide, but he knew the
King would prefer the best answer he could make
than no reply at all, so he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One shot might cost Your Majesty a <i>Friedrich
d&rsquo;or</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued the King, &ldquo;and how many
<i>Friedrich d&rsquo;ors</i> do you suppose those fellows over
there are worth?&rdquo; At last the King said: &ldquo;Well,
you may fire a few shots, nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was done, but the firing was useless.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the insecure position of his army,
the King had so little fear of attack that his generals
felt it their duty to warn him and to try to dissuade
him from his purpose. The camp was so poorly
protected that Field-Marshal Keith one day said:
&ldquo;If the Austrians do not attack us here, they
deserve to be hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied the King, &ldquo;let us hope they are
more afraid of us than of the gallows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>The Austrian general&rsquo;s plans were so well made
that the proud King had to expiate his contempt in
defeat. On the 14th of October, before daybreak,
Daun surrounded Hochkirch, in the vicinity of
which the Prussians were encamped. They were
resting in fancied security when they were suddenly
roused by the dreadful thunder of cannon. The
whole army was thrown into confusion. Soldiers
ran over each other and could hardly find their
weapons. In a wild scramble they tried to form in
line, but no one could find his comrade, for the
enemy&rsquo;s grapeshot was strewing the ground with bodies.
The confusion knew no bounds; everyone was
rushing about shouting and panic-stricken, the officers
were powerless to check the tumult and disorder.</p>
<p>Zieten and Seydlitz, expecting the enemy&rsquo;s attack,
had not allowed their men to leave their horses
through the night. They endeavored to do something,
but in the darkness they could not distinguish
friend from foe, or escape the murderous fire which
mowed down the Prussian ranks as if they had been
rows of corn. Never did the sun rise upon a more
dreadful spectacle. They turned their eyes away
from it, and many of the grizzled warriors could not
restrain their tears as they looked upon the awful
sight. The signal for retreat was sounded, and notwithstanding
the terror and confusion of the scene
it was executed in such a masterly manner that Daun
was astonished. He did not attempt to pursue, but
fell back to his camp as if nothing had occurred.
The Prussian loss was excessive. More than nine
thousand bodies were lying in that narrow camp
area. Beside this, they lost one hundred cannon
and nearly all their tents and baggage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The King had to summon up all his courage.
At eleven o&rsquo;clock that morning he had sadly gazed
from an eminence at the fragments of his shattered
army. He forced himself to assume a cheerful air,
for he knew that all eyes were fixed upon him and
that his soldiers were looking to him for consolation
and fresh assurance. Therefore he appeared unmoved,
and when General Von der Goltz joined him
he said, in a facetious way: &ldquo;My dear Goltz, they
did not wake us up very politely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied the General,
&ldquo;we do not usually talk by day about the things
which trouble us in sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;but some bright
day I will return the incivility of these gentlemen
who woke us up so rudely.&rdquo; Though only joking,
the King had spoken prophetic words.</p>
<p>We know from the statements of those most
intimate with him how deeply Frederick felt this
matter. As, after the defeat at Kollin, his troubles
were increased by the news of the death of his beloved
mother, so now, in the very hour of his defeat
at Hochkirch, he heard the sad news of the death
of his sister Wilhelmina,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> the sharer of his youthful
troubles. But painful as this news was, when he
reflected upon the dangers impending over the
Fatherland he controlled his grief and devoted himself
to his kingly duties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Some days after this, October 17, the King summoned
all his generals and staff officers and thus
addressed them: &ldquo;You are aware, gentlemen, that
the army has suffered from a surprise. The darkness
of the night was accountable for it. You must
now consider our situation. We are in upper
Lusatia. Our property, our wives, our children are
far behind us. If we weaken in the least, all will
be lost. An immediate battle is inevitable. Rather
than submit, I will be buried with the rest of my
army. I suppose that every one of you thinks as
I do. He who does not, can be spared; he can go
home immediately. Is there such a one among
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All present hastened to assure the King that they
would do their duty as they had always done it.
Frederick listened to their declaration with much
satisfaction, and replied: &ldquo;I am delighted, gentlemen,
to find the same devotion and self-sacrifice
you have always shown. I thank you for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His heavy losses at Hochkirch greatly troubled
Frederick, but he consoled himself with the thought
of his next great battle. At this time he wrote to a
friend:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;The affair of October 14 ought to have decided
the campaign, but it was nothing more than a scratch.
A great battle must decide our fate. In all likelihood
we shall have one very soon and then, with
the result in our favor, we can rejoice. It has
required many troops and much skill to get us thus
far along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Frederick was occupied with his great
plans to avenge his defeat, Daun remained quietly
in his camp on the lookout, rejoicing over the disaster
and confident that the Prussians had had
enough of it. On the other hand, the King, who
was always prompt in decision, sent speedy couriers
to his brother Henry, in Saxony, with instructions
for him to march into upper Lusatia with his seven
thousand men and join his command. Meanwhile
he kept a sharp watch upon the enemy. One
Autumn morning, about daybreak, as he was riding
out in search of information, attended by some under-officers,
the fog grew so dense that they could only
see a few paces ahead of them. They rode along a
carriage road, the King having the idea that by turning
to the right they could avoid the enemy&rsquo;s outposts.
Adjutant von Oppen, however, noticed that
they had already gone too far. &ldquo;Upon my soul,
Your Majesty,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we are already too far to the
left and are certainly behind the enemy&rsquo;s outposts.&rdquo;
Scarcely had he said the last word, when an Austrian
hussar appeared at their right to see who was
talking. The King, with his usual presence of mind,
advanced to the Austrian and coolly asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hussar, where does this road lead?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>The hussar saw at once they were Prussians, but
he was so struck by the tone of voice and looks of
the King, as well as by his coolness, that he stood
as speechless and motionless as a statue. With the
utmost composure, the King remarked: &ldquo;Gentlemen,
proceed. The hussar does not know.&rdquo; They
rode quickly away under cover of the fog, which put
an end to further observations. Frederick often
related this incident afterward and laughed heartily
over it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Prince Henry soon arrived with his re&euml;nforcements.
Thus strengthened, the King by skilful
man&oelig;uvres succeeded in getting round the Austrians
without their knowledge, and reaching Silesia,
where the enemy was again trying to secure a foothold.
Upon Frederick&rsquo;s appearance, however, the
enemy retired. He believed he could drive the
Austrians out of Neisse without serious effort and
make himself master of Silesia. Daun was not a little
surprised at the news. He was greatly astonished
at the shrewdness of his adversary, and was much
chagrined that the disaster at Hochkirch had not
been of the least advantage to him. He longed to
perform some great deed, and, as nothing better
suggested itself to him, he decided to march into
Saxony and wrest Dresden from the hands of the
Prussians. But he reckoned without his host.
Perhaps he believed that he could accomplish his
purpose by merely demanding the surrender of the
city. But he made a sad mistake. Schmettau,
the commander, was not alarmed, and replied to the
demand for surrender: &ldquo;I will defend myself from
street to street and finish up in the ruins of the
Elector&rsquo;s palace.&rdquo; When Daun received this
emphatic reply and was convinced that Schmettau
meant what he said, he quickly withdrew, so that
he should not be surprised by the King, and went
into Winter quarters in Bohemia.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The most dreadful Day in Frederick&rsquo;s Life</span></h2>
<p>The year 1758 came to its close, and after
a survey of his military operations it must
be said that Frederick, notwithstanding
many disasters, had made great headway
against the legions of his enemies. He had again
beaten them back and gloriously ended the year&rsquo;s
campaign. His generals had also shown great skill
in military operations. Belling, in particular, had
bravely held his ground, and driven the Swedes
back to Stralsund and the island of R&uuml;gen. Duke
Ferdinand of Brunswick had been equally successful
in his campaign against the French.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>At the commencement of this year, war broke
out first in Westphalia. The French attempted to
overwhelm Duke Ferdinand by superior numbers.
They despatched two strong armies against him, one
of which went to Frankfurt and the other to D&uuml;sseldorf.
The Duke decided to attack the army at
Frankfurt, and fought a stubborn battle at Bergen.
The French were in such strong position that the
Prussians could not dislodge them, but were forced
to fall back. The enemy pursued on foot and,
harassed by superior numbers, they were forced to
retreat to Bremen on the Weser. The enemies of
Prussia held a jubilee. They were now certain that
Westphalia, Hesse, Brunswick, and Hanover would
be held by the French for all time, and that a sufficient
force of commissioners would be sent over
from Paris to establish French dominion over these
fine German provinces. The Duke, however, did
not entertain any such idea, for suddenly he again
took the offensive and attacked the other army
while on its way from D&uuml;sseldorf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Ferdinand came upon the French camp at Minden
and gave battle on the plains near that city, August
1, 1759. The attack began at the village of Todtenhausen.
Count Wilhelm of B&uuml;ckeburg, commanding
the Prussian artillery, had taken a strong
position. His fire played such havoc in the close
ranks of the French that they were forced to fall
back. The artillery was the first to retreat and the
cavalry followed its example, which left great gaps
in the ranks of the infantry and created much disorder.
The Duke lost no time in following up his
advantage. He ordered Sackville, the English
general, to attack the enemy with his cavalry.
There had been bad feeling between the two leaders
for some time, so that concerted action between
them was well-nigh impossible. As it was, the
English general held back long enough to lose
the advantage of the critical moment, so that the
enemy, who could not have escaped annihilation
had the attack been promptly made, had time
enough to get into order and effect a retreat.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> As
it was, however, seven thousand prisoners were
captured, and twenty-five cannon and several standards
fell into the hands of the Prussians. The
French were pursued for some distance, and did not
find safety until they reached their camp at Frankfurt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The news of this brilliant victory surprised the
King just as he was in the midst of preparations for
a terrible struggle with the enemy. He was in a
strong position at Landeshut, and to the great astonishment
of his enemies he remained there quietly
until the middle of the year, apparently waiting to
see what the Russians and Austrians were going to
do. They had improved the intervening time in
strengthening their depleted ranks, and now proposed
to move against the Prussians in a body and
with largely increased numbers. Frederick, all this
time, was not unmindful of their plans, and considerably
strengthened his own army; but even then he
had only half as many troops as the enemy. The
larger part of his choicest soldiers had been left on
the field of honor, and it was with much anxiety
that he regarded further campaigning. When news
came of the Russian advance he was ignorant from
what direction the attack would be made, as they
were approaching the Brandenburg frontier in
several divisions. To strengthen themselves and
get in readiness for the great task awaiting them, it
was decided that the brave Austrian General Laudon
should unite his force of twenty thousand men with
their force. Frederick, who was apprised of their
plans, attempted to thwart them, and sent Generals
Dohna and Wedell against them, but they were
driven back, and the Austro-Russian combination
was effected. The King had not believed this possible,
and he was greatly surprised, therefore, by the
news that the combined army, seventy thousand
strong, was advancing to the Oder with designs
upon the capital,<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> the road to which was open. The
King now made his plans to frustrate the movement,
and ordered the rapid advance of his army. He
felt a fatal presentiment, and before he set out left
his will with Prince Henry, and committed the
administration of the kingdom to him in case anything
happened to himself. He made all his arrangements
with the same care that one displays when
about to engage in a hazardous task. He provided
for every emergency, and cautioned his brother
against making a dishonorable peace after his death.
With such gloomy thoughts as these the King
advanced to meet his enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>On the eleventh of August, 1759, Frederick encountered
his enemies fifty miles from Berlin. They
were strongly entrenched at Kunersdorf<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> and surrounded
by batteries of cannon, whose yawning
mouths threatened death and destruction to anyone
who came near them. Notwithstanding the great
superiority of the enemies&rsquo; numbers and the exceeding
strength of their batteries, the King decided to
attack the combined armies August 12. At that
very time a courier from Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick
arrived with the good news of the victory at
Minden. The King now was in such confident
mood that he ordered the courier to put off his
return a few days, so that he could send back an
equally joyful message of victory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Toward noon the signal was given for attack,
and the battle began with good fortune on the
Prussian side. Encouraged by their King, the brave
troops displayed again that heroic courage which
had aroused universal admiration. They paid no
attention to the awful fire which was devastating
their ranks; with utter contempt for death they
charged battery after battery, until the Russian left
wing could no longer withstand their assaults. It
was driven from its position and seventy cannon fell
into their hands. It was a sign that the Goddess
of Victory this time favored the Prussians.</p>
<p>By this time the day was nearly spent, and the
soldiers, exhausted by their long struggle, aroused
the sympathy of their leaders. Some of the oldest
and most experienced of them urgently appealed to
the King to stop the battle and spare the soldiers,
as the enemy was retreating. Frederick, however,
remained unmoved. He was not contented with
the advantage he had gained. No, he would immediately
annihilate the enemy. He ordered Seydlitz
to cut his way through them with the cavalry.
It was in vain, however, that Seydlitz explained he
was holding Laudon in check on the right wing of
the Russians. It was in vain that he assured the
King the meadows before them were so swampy
that horses and riders would be stuck in the bogs
if they ventured there. All that he said was of
no avail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your duty and execute the orders of your
King,&rdquo; replied Frederick, firmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Seydlitz saluted and obeyed, but the soundness
of his suggestions was realized only too soon. The
ground shook under the squadrons as they got into
motion, and soon they were floundering in the
swamp. As if they were anticipating just such an
inconsiderate movement, the Russians and Austrians
furiously assaulted their immovable enemy, and such
bloodshed ensued that the green meadows were
crimsoned. Seydlitz himself was carried off the
field wounded. The tired-out Prussians were
panic-stricken. All fled who could, and the commands
even of their highest officers were ineffective
to stay the retreat. The Prussian army was not
only defeated, it was destroyed. The battle was
irretrievably lost, the ruin was complete. Pursued
by the enemy, the unfortunates sought protection,
and found it only in the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>The King had been conspicuous in his efforts to
avert this disastrous defeat. He was in the very
thick of the battle and did his utmost to keep the
troops in line and encourage them. His attention
was called to the danger he was in and he was
besought to be more careful, but he emphatically
refused, saying: &ldquo;No! We must all strive for victory
together, and I must do my duty like everyone
else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p4.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="589" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>Frederick stood on the bloody field like one dazed</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>In the main attack two horses were shot down
under him. Mounting a third, a bullet passed
through his overcoat and shattered a gold case in
his waistcoat pocket. All his efforts, however, were
useless. His exhortations had lost their customary
inspiring effect. Throwing away weapons and
accoutrements, everyone sought safety in flight.
He was not only compelled to witness the abandoning
of the cannon captured from the Russians,
but to mourn the loss of one hundred and sixty-five
pieces of Prussian artillery. The situation became
more and more desperate, and at last, realizing all
was lost, he exclaimed in utter despair: &ldquo;Is there
not a cursed bullet for me to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When night came on, he was almost the only
living soul on the wide battlefield. His army was
partly scattered about the surrounding country;
the rest of it had been put to flight.</p>
<p>Frederick stood on the bloody field like one
dazed, and it was only by chance he was saved from
capture by some Russians and Austrians who approached
the spot where he was standing. Captain
Prittiwitz, his fortunate star, happened to be passing
near by, with forty hussars. Lieutenant Belten
suddenly exclaimed: &ldquo;Captain Prittiwitz, yonder
stands the King.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>The captain immediately turned his horse and
rode forward with his men to the King, who was
standing with folded arms upon a sandy hillock and
alone, save for a single attendant who held his horse.
His sword was sticking in the sand in front of him.
The captain had considerable trouble in persuading
the King to mount his horse, for at that instant
Frederick was on the very verge of despair. To
the appeal of the captain, he replied: &ldquo;Leave me,
Prittiwitz; I am lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, Your Majesty,&rdquo; answered Prittiwitz;
&ldquo;you are still King of Prussia and commander of
an army of brave soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you think so, forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hussars surrounded Frederick and made
their way to the Oder, with roving bands of Cossacks
continually swarming about them. Prittiwitz
kept off the insolent pack and shot their leader off
his horse. After the Muhl was safely crossed there
was no further trouble, and the King was left uninjured
at a ferryman&rsquo;s hut. He thanked the captain,
ordered that gifts be distributed among the hussars,
and gave instructions to see that he remained undisturbed
until he had time to collect himself, for he
was still overmastered by his calamity. He wrote
to his minister, Finkenstein, in Berlin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provide for the safety of the Queen and the
royal family at Magdeburg, and do all you can for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few hours later, he sent the following message
to him:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a terrible disaster. I shall not survive it.
The consequences of the battle will be worse than
the battle itself. I have no further resources and,
to tell the truth, I consider everything lost. I shall
not survive the destruction of the Fatherland.
Adieu forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the most dreadful day in the life of
the great King.</p>
<p>It is not surprising, however, that the King was
in such a despondent mood, for on that very evening
he could not have assembled five thousand men
of his magnificent army. Twenty-six thousand were
killed, wounded, or prisoners, and the others were
scattered in flight. But the Russian army also
suffered dreadfully. &ldquo;If I should fight one more
such battle,&rdquo; said its commanding general, &ldquo;I should
take the news of it to St. Petersburg myself with a
staff in my hand.&rdquo; It was not long, however, before
Frederick regained his composure. It was
characteristic of him that he was always the greatest
when things were going badly. Messengers flew to
Berlin and C&uuml;strin with orders that artillery should
be despatched to him as quickly as possible. He
collected his fugitive troops, re&euml;nforced them with
other detachments, and within a short time an army
of eighteen thousand men was at his disposal. The
most important thing for him now was to rouse the
courage of his officers. To this end he sent for
the messenger who had brought the news of the
victory in Westphalia, and said to him in their
hearing: &ldquo;You have seen what has been going on
here. Hurry back, and if you find the enemy is
not in Berlin or Magdeburg, tell the Duke not
much has yet been lost.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>In view of Frederick&rsquo;s plight and the general
condition of his affairs, this message must have
seemed ridiculous, for he had not a sufficient force
in readiness to stay the victorious advance of the
Russians or to defend the capital and the country.
This was known abroad also, for word was sent
from Paris to the Russian general that the King of
Prussia must be exterminated, and Berlin and the
whole Mark of Brandenburg devastated. The
Austrian Field-Marshal Daun also urged the Russians
to make a rapid advance. Soltikow, their
commander, however, did not move, and when
further urged by Daun, almost suppliantly, to
hurry forward, he simply wrote to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have won two battles, and am waiting before
I advance again for news of a second one from you.
It is not fair that my Emperor&rsquo;s army should have
to do all the work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Of course this jealousy among the enemy&rsquo;s
leaders was of the greatest advantage to the King
and the Fatherland. The Russians were in position
at Frankfurt-on-the-Oder, and it was not until
they were stirred up on all sides that they moved
at all. When they did, they could not find subsistence,
and at the end of October they went back
again into Poland, which relieved the Prussians of
one imminent danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Field-Marshal Daun in the meantime had been held
in check in Saxony in a most masterly way by Prince
Henry. The Prince was one of the ablest generals
of his time, and his brother, the King, fully recognized
it. He said of him once, &ldquo;He is the only
general who has not made a mistake during the
entire war.&rdquo; Beside his strategic talent, he had
engaging personal qualities which commended him
to friend and foe alike. To him was assigned the
duty of watching over the Electorate of Saxony. It
may well be believed that he was an unwelcome
visitor in the enemy&rsquo;s country, but he was greatly
respected by the Saxons, and years after this they
told with much emotion how this noble Hohenzollern
in 1759, one day in harvest-time, when a sudden
storm threatened to ruin their cornfields, allowed
the peasants of a Saxon village to use his own horses
for getting in their corn. He specially displayed
his brilliant qualities in preventing Field-Marshal
Daun from effecting a union with the Russians. By
swift and skilful marches he kept Daun moving here
and there, then suddenly eluded him, and destroyed
a number of storehouses with supplies sufficient
to have maintained fifty thousand soldiers for six
months. This caused such a scarcity of subsistence
and fodder that the indignant troops began to complain,
and Daun had to fall back to a better position.
The Mark of Brandenburg was safe, but other misfortunes
were in store for Frederick. Dresden was
in the hands of the enemy as one of the immediate
results of the battle of Kunersdorf. When hardest
pressed, Frederick wrote the commander in the
Saxon capital to save if possible the seven millions
of treasure in the money chests and evacuate with
honor, for he could not send him help. This occurred
immediately after the disastrous battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>When Frederick was himself once more, he
changed his mind, but alas! it was too late. Dresden
was already lost to the Prussians. Frederick stamped
with rage and declared he would retake it. He at
once ordered the army to move into Saxony, although
the inclement season of the year had begun. Prince
Henry begged the King to spare his troops during
the Winter and put off any large undertakings he
had in view, but it was all in vain. The King
would not listen to him. He ordered General
Finck to attack the enemy&rsquo;s rear with fifteen thousand
men and force him to retreat. Every tactician
foresaw the disastrous consequences. All his generals
were of opinion that the attack would end
calamitously, and so it turned out. Finck had
hardly reached Maxen, November 21, 1759, before
the tables were turned. Instead of being the attacking
party, he himself was attacked on all sides.
Terrible slaughter ensued. The Prussians resisted
the attack with their customary bravery, but finally
had to succumb. The army was nearly wiped out,
as eleven thousand of them were taken prisoners.
Never before had a year been so disastrous for
Frederick as was 1759. Never before did a year
close more gloomily for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Battle of Liegnitz</span></h2>
<p>The deplorable result of these operations
weighed heavily upon the King and never
before did he inaugurate a campaign in a
more despondent mood than that of 1760.
It affected all his movements and all his actions and
at last it seemed as if his lucky star would never
shine again. In Silesia, the Austrian General Laudon,
with a force three times greater, attacked
General Fouqu&eacute;, and his eight thousand men.
Fouqu&eacute; defended himself with the courage of a lion,
and his soldiers fought none the less bravely, but he
had the misfortune to be thrown from his horse in
such a way that the animal fell upon him and undoubtedly
would have crushed him to death but for
the opportune arrival of his faithful groom. Only
such troopers as had swift enough horses escaped
from the scene of slaughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Frederick meanwhile was busy with his plans for
retaking Dresden. He closely invested that city,
but whatever moves he made were immediately
thwarted by the Austrian general, who made a resolute
defence of the post entrusted to him. The
failure of his plans only made the King still more
despondent. His best friends and most experienced
generals suffered greatly from his ill humor, for he
was often not only severe, but grossly unjust. He
called the soldiers of one regiment cowards, and cut
off the decorations from their uniforms beside taking
away their sidearms and badges of honor. One
blow after another struck the King. Hardly had
he learned of the destruction of Fouqu&eacute;&rsquo;s corps
when the unhappy news came that General Laudon
had taken the important fortress of Glatz. Everyone
now expected another wrathful outbreak from
the King, but on the contrary he remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so! But they will have to give it back
when peace is made. We must now go to Silesia
lest we lose everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His decision was executed almost as soon as it
was announced. While on the way, Daun was near
him on one side and the Austrian General Lacy on
the other. The three armies were so close together
that they might easily have been mistaken for one.
The light troops had frequent skirmishes, and hardly
a day passed without encounters. Thus they fought
their way along to Liegnitz. Further advance of
the King was now impossible, for Laudon appeared
in front of him. He was completely surrounded
by the Austrian armies. The enemy&rsquo;s leaders were
jubilant over the prospect of capturing the King
and his entire army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;The net is made in which we will capture the
whole Prussian army,&rdquo; they said, contemptuously.
&ldquo;We have only to cast it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King was informed of their boast and laughingly
replied: &ldquo;That may be so, but I think I can
make a hole in that net which they can&rsquo;t sew up
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were prophetic words.</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s army now was so closely hemmed in
by the Austrians that a mouse could not have
slipped through, and the transportation of subsistence
was impossible. Instead of commissary
bread, zwiebach was distributed among the soldiers.
The King often diverted himself toward evening
by walking or riding among the squadrons of the
<i>Garde du Corps</i> and talking with the men in a joking
way, so as to keep them in good spirits and arouse
hope for better times. Upon one such occasion
he happened upon an under-officer who had broken
his zwiebach and mixed it with a flask of red wine
in the camp kettle, hanging over the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of red soup is that you have there?&rdquo;
asked the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;that soup cost
me seven thalers in cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoho! hoho!&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is red wine and zwiebach. I spent my last
ducat<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> that I might have a little comfort once
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it has cost that much, I would like to
know how it tastes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Your Majesty, but I have only a
tin spoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes no difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the King took a spoonful of the soup
and said: &ldquo;This is really very good, but it is too
expensive. But I thank you just the same, and you
must come soon and eat with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King shortly afterward ordered the officer
to come to his headquarters, and there he appeased
his hunger with such food as Frederick ate. Beside
this, the King gave him a handsome sum in
gold. In such ways as these he managed to win
the love and respect of his soldiers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>To the astonishment of all, Daun decided upon
a battle, hoping thus to ensure the destruction of
the Prussian army. The decisive blow was to be
struck August 15, and to make it all the more
decisive he arranged for an attack at daybreak and
a repetition of the slaughter at Hochkirch. This
time, however, Frederick was fortunate enough to
hear of the plan and he made a counterplan at once.
The Prussian army left its camp in absolute silence
during the night and occupied the neighboring
heights; and to make the Austrians believe it was
resting quietly in its old position, peasants were
employed to keep the campfires burning brightly.</p>
<p>Noiselessly Frederick arranged his army in
fighting order. Silently the regiments stood in
rank and listened for the signal to attack. There
was something weird in the spectacle. The infantry
stood with weapons ready for attack, and bright
sabres flashed in the stout fists of the troopers ready
at any instant to strike. Far down in the east day
was dawning, and the silent host in the gray dusk
looked like a troop of spectres.</p>
<p>To enjoy a moment&rsquo;s rest, Generals Seydlitz and
Zieten threw themselves down by a campfire and
slept; but Frederick, sitting upon a drumhead, considered
the plans of the coming battle. At last he
too was overcome by fatigue, and lying by the side
of his generals was soon asleep. Suddenly a major
rushed up and loudly asked, &ldquo;Where is the King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter, somewhat startled, arose at once and
answered, &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The enemy is not four hundred yards away,&rdquo;
was his reply.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">

<p class="caption"><i>Frederick at the watch-fire before the battle of Liegnitz</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Officers and men were at once on the alert.
Two minutes sufficed to form the regiments in
order. Words of command were heard on all sides.
The cavalry made ready for the onset. The thunder
of artillery resounded over hill and valley, and
in less than ten minutes the battle was raging.
Frederick&rsquo;s invincible spirit worked wonders. General
Laudon had not expected such a reception and
was utterly astonished to find a powerful force
confronting him when he expected to surprise the
Prussians in their camp. But in this emergency
everything depended upon energy and courage. He
made a brave assault, but the Prussians made a
braver resistance. They fought like lions, and if it
had been lighter the enemy would have been mercilessly
slaughtered. When the sun rose it illuminated
the field covered with bodies and broken
weapons. The four hours&rsquo; sanguinary conflict was
decided. The Prussians won a complete victory,
and the Austrians lost ten thousand men, beside
twenty-three standards and eighty-two cannon.
Thus ended the battle of Liegnitz, August 15, 1760.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Victory of Torgau Surprises Frederick</span></h2>
<p>Cavalry and infantry were so exhausted
by the bloody work that the King granted
them a three hours&rsquo; rest. Frederick went
through the camp-lines, where there was
great rejoicing over the victory, one of the most
important results of which was the reawakening of
the old battle spirit. There had not been such a
glorious event since the disaster at Kunersdorf.
He commended their valor, and assured them they
should be rewarded at the proper time. The regiment
which had lost its decorations at the close of
the battle before Dresden behaved so bravely that
the King uncovered his head before its commander
and cordially thanked him. One old gray-bearded
warrior, hoping that the King, while in this gracious
mood, might restore to the regiment its trophies
and sidearms, stepped forward and pleaded for
them. The King quietly listened and then with
much emotion replied:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, children, you have done handsomely. I
thank you. You shall have everything back. All
is forgotten and forgiven. But this day I shall
never forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loud cheers filled the air at the regiment&rsquo;s good
fortune. After they were rested they formed on the
field, strewn with the debris of battle, took the
cannon and prisoners along, and made a three hours&rsquo;
march on that same day. This one victory placed
Silesia, partly captured from the Austrians, in
Prussian hands.</p>
<p>The King pursued the Austrians vigorously, and
used his utmost endeavors to force them from their
position. In one of his movements it became
necessary to burn a village in the Silesian hills, to
keep the Austrians from occupying a certain height.
An officer, whose mother belonged in the village,
happened to receive the order to burn it, and performed
his duty without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.
This induced the King to interest himself in the
family. He not only reimbursed her generously, but
every time he met the officer he remembered the
occurrence and inquired about his mother&rsquo;s health.
The unconditional surrender of Silesia made that
country very dear to him. He used to call it &ldquo;The
Pearl of his Crown,&rdquo; and used his utmost efforts to
free it from the hated enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Greatly to his disappointment, he was suddenly
compelled to abandon further pursuit, for he learned
that the Mark was in danger of falling into the
enemy&rsquo;s hands. Forty-eight thousand Austrians
and Russians had set out to capture Berlin, and
reached the frontier unchecked. They knew that
the weak city garrison was in no condition to resist
the advance of such a strong army. The Prussian
Residence actually fell into the hands of the Russian
General Tottleben, October 4, 1760. Reports of
cruelties practised by the Russians on the march had
preceded their coming, and the people were greatly
apprehensive of violence. Their apprehensions,
however, were needless, as Tottleben was a very
noble and humane man and exerted himself constantly
to suppress all acts of violence. In reality,
the Russians conducted themselves courteously as
compared with the Saxons and Austrians, who committed
outrageous acts of violence and vandalism.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a>
For eight days they gave free rein to their rapacity
and maltreatment, when suddenly the rumor spread
and was publicly talked about that the King was
approaching. Its effect was electrical. Taking all
they could lay hands on, they hurriedly made off,
for they feared his wrath. When Frederick heard
that the mere rumor of his approach had so alarmed
the enemy, he laughed loudly and said in the
presence of his men: &ldquo;And such louts as these
would cope with us Prussians!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>He liked to joke with his soldiers, and took it in
the best of humor when they joked back with him.
On the march from Silesia to the Mark, which was
a very quick one, the King often said to them when
they were tired: &ldquo;Straighten up, children, straighten
up,&rdquo; meaning that they should march straighter and
in better order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fritz, we can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; was the reply; and one
hussar, whom the King had personally addressed,
said to him: &ldquo;Fritz, I can&rsquo;t do it; I can&rsquo;t pull up
my boots,&rdquo; at which the King laughed heartily.</p>
<p>It was on such intimate footing as this that the
King stood with his men. He also knew just what
demands he could make of them. They willingly
made their utmost exertions on the long, hard
marches. They would gladly die for him. He
naturally shared all their troubles and deprivations.
He had good reason therefore to write these words
to one of his friends:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can have no conception of our dreadful
fatigues. This movement is worse than any of its
predecessors. Sometimes I do not know which
way to turn. But I will not weary you with the
recital of my troubles and anxieties. All my happiness
is buried with the loved and revered ones to
whom my heart clings. The close of my life is full
of sorrow and pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As already said, Frederick found no enemy in
Charlottenburg and its vicinity. Daun had fallen
back to Saxony and taken a strong position at Torgau,
so that by skilfully distributing his force he
could drive back the Prussians and hold almost the
whole country. Frederick found himself in a very
bad position. The Russians were on the Oder in
his rear, and in front the Austrians occupied an
almost impregnable position. Under such circumstances
it was difficult to find a safe way out. He
hastily decided to move against the Austrians, but
was at once deterred from so doing when he found
their position was impregnable. It was now really
a question of life or death. The King realized
only too well that he could hardly have found a
more disagreeable situation, but he did not disclose
his anxiety. He forced himself to conceal his real
feelings under a mask of cheerfulness rather than
risk losing everything. It is even asserted indeed
that in the last years of the Seven Years&rsquo; War, when
Frederick saw that the strength of his army was
steadily diminishing while his enemies maintained
their numbers, he carried opium with him with
which to take his life if at last he had to succumb
to their united strength. He said to a friend at
this time:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never see the moment that forces me to
make a disadvantageous peace. Either I will bury
myself under the ruins of the Fatherland, or, should
fate forbid me that consolation, I will put an end to
my troubles when I no longer can bear them. I
have acted according to the inner voice of conscience
and honor, which guides and has always guided my
steps, and my conduct will always be grounded on
those principles. I sacrificed my youth to my
father, my riper years to the Fatherland; now I
think I have the right to dispose of my old age.
I have said to you, and I repeat it, never will I put
my hand to a disadvantageous peace. I am determined
to finish this campaign and to venture the
most desperate things, for I will conquer or honorably
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How heavily his anxiety wore upon him at this
time is shown in another letter to a friend, in which
he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am slowly wasting away; I am like a living
body gradually growing speechless, and losing limb
by limb. Heaven help us! We need it. You
always talk of me and my dangers. Do you not
know it is not necessary for me to live? It is only
necessary to do my duty and fight for the Fatherland
and save it if possible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>In such a despondent mood as this was the King
in the presence of the enemy at Torgau! What
was to be done? If he quietly abandoned the place
to the enemy, he must spend the Winter in his own
country, already nearly exhausted. If he attacked
and was defeated, he would lose all Prussia. He
must venture everything, but before acting he decided
to summon all his generals for a consultation.
This took place on the morning of November 3,
1760. General Zieten, one of his most trusted
friends, did not immediately appear, which greatly
disturbed the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said to them, &ldquo;we can do nothing,
for one of our number is not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He anxiously looked in the direction whence
Zieten should come. At last the old general came
riding up. Frederick hastened to meet him, embraced
him, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my dear Zieten, I have been anxiously
waiting for you, for to-day will be a memorable one.
Either I shall conquer or I shall end my troubles,
for my position is very critical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the pious old Zieten, as he dismounted
and stroked his beard, &ldquo;do you doubt the
help of God? He has stood by us often and will
do so to-day. Your soldiers are full of courage.
They trust their God.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>These words restored the King&rsquo;s confidence.
&ldquo;Well, my dear Zieten,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;if you think
it all right, we will face the inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking Zieten&rsquo;s arm, they withdrew from the
others for a time and had a confidential interview,
after which he returned in better spirits. It was
decided to attack, and the aides were soon flying in
all directions, carrying the orders to the generals.
The attack began that day.</p>
<p>The Prussian army was in two divisions, one led
by the King, and the other by Zieten, who got in
the rear of the enemy to attack his entrenchments.
The King&rsquo;s division consisted of ten thousand grenadiers
and was posted in some woods in battle order.
When Frederick advanced with his vanguard upon
Daun&rsquo;s entrenchments he was greeted by a murderous
fire from two hundred cannon, so directed that
even before the troops reached the enemy&rsquo;s lines
they were almost unfitted for action, as they were
deafened by the terrible crashes of the artillery.
Notwithstanding the din and confusion, the King
retained his composure, and turning to one of his
generals, said: &ldquo;What a horrible cannonading!
Did you ever hear anything like it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The effect was frightful. In a short time nearly
all the brave grenadiers were shot down. Their
places were filled by fresh regiments and the cavalry
was ordered to advance, but it was useless. Nothing
could withstand that murderous fire. In the meantime
Frederick himself was exposed to the greatest
danger. Shots ploughed up the earth so near him
that his horse was very restive. At last he had to
make a show of composure. He rode from the first
rank to the second, and came to a dragoon regiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, children, how goes it? &rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Some answered, &ldquo;Badly, Your Majesty; we are
standing here letting them shoot us down, and we
cannot defend ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a little,&rdquo; said the King to them, &ldquo;the firing
will soon cease; then we will attack them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While saying these words a cannon-ball came so
close to him that his horse jumped to one side,
knocked over a drum, and seemed about to run away
with him. The King smiled, and said to the drummer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell the Austrians if they don&rsquo;t soon march
off, I will take their guns away from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new attack was ordered, but the Austrians
resumed their destructive fire. At this crisis the
King noticed there was a great gap on the right
wing, between the <i>Garde du Corps</i> and the <i>gens
d&rsquo;armes</i>. He rode where the shots were falling
thickest, to strengthen the weak spot. When this
had been done, he remained there a short time,
watching with his glass one of the batteries which
was playing havoc with the <i>Garde du Corps</i>. A
corporal of the fourth company remarked to a
guard: &ldquo;If we have got to stand here and be shot
at, because they won&rsquo;t let us attack, give me a
pinch of snuff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>The guard took his box from his pouch, and as
he was lifting the cover, a cannon-ball shot off his
head. In the most cold-blooded way, the corporal
turned to his second neighbor and said: &ldquo;Well,
now, you give me a pinch; that one has gone to
the d&mdash;l.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Lieutenant von Byern, who afterward
became leader of a cuirassier regiment, was speaking
with the man about the accident, another ball
killed his horse. The King, who had been watching
them closely, rode up to the lieutenant, and then
said to the corporal: &ldquo;You have the proper coolness
of a soldier. I shall remember you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal was overjoyed because the King
had honored him by addressing him, which aroused
his hope of promotion.</p>
<p>The <i>Garde du Corps</i> suffered greatly in this
battle, for they were exposed to the fire of the
battery already mentioned, and every discharge
killed some of them. The King greatly deplored
it, but he could not relieve them right away. He
rode up to them and said in a tone of deep
sympathy: &ldquo;Children, only have patience for a few
minutes. Things will quickly change.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>At that instant a shot came close to the King
and killed the file leader of the fourth company of
the second squadron. His next neighbor said to
the King: &ldquo;Be careful of yourself, Your Majesty,
and ride to a safer place. It is more important you
should live than we.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King turned a grateful look to the speaker and
said: &ldquo;My dear son, I thank you for your honest
intentions and good-will. I shall not forget you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had the King gone when a shot killed this
honest man on the spot.</p>
<p>The attack was renewed by the Prussians, but
their valor was of no avail against the strongly entrenched
enemy. Night was approaching, but the
Austrians had not been dislodged from their position.
Firing was still kept up vigorously on both
sides, and the combatants were shot down in rows.
Frederick himself did not escape untouched. A
bullet stunned him, and with the words, &ldquo;I am
killed,&rdquo; he fell. Two of his aides instantly ran up
to him and searched for the wound, but his thick
pelisse had saved him. Opening it, they found
that the bullet had passed through his heavy clothing,
but had not pierced his body. The King
speedily came to himself and coolly said: &ldquo;It is a
matter of no consequence.&rdquo; The bullet, however,
had made a bad contusion on his breast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>As night came on, confusion spread through the
ranks, and Frederick was not a little disturbed about
the result of the battle. He looked upon it as lost,
and the Austrians were rejoicing over the victory
they supposed they had gained. Both sides, however,
were premature in their conclusions, for almost
immediately the situation took on a new aspect.</p>
<p>In carrying out his orders, Zieten had had to
contend with almost insuperable obstacles before
he could get to the place to which he had been
assigned. After almost superhuman exertions he
reached, toward evening, the S&uuml;ptitz heights. His
soldiers dragged their cannon by hand and planted
them on a hill near the enemy. With drums beating
and cannon thundering, Zieten advanced to the
attack, and at the very first onset captured a battery,
causing great alarm and confusion among the Austrians.
Field-Marshal Daun rallied all his forces
and tried to drive the Prussians out of his entrenchments,
but the effort was fruitless. Zieten, clearly
realizing what was at stake, so continuously pressed
his assaults that the Austrians could not withstand
them. They began to waver, and General Daun
was so badly wounded that he had to be carried
from the field. This new misfortune increased
their panic, and Zieten gave them no chance to get
over it. He hurled his entire force upon them, and
the victory was won.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>The King, meanwhile, knew nothing of Zieten&rsquo;s
successful attack and its important results, as the
intervening darkness cut off his view of the field.
Fancying the battle was lost, or at least that the
victory was doubtful, he rode to the neighboring
village of Elsnitz, where he went into a church, as
all other places were filled with wounded. It was a
very cold night. While tired-out, shivering soldiers
sought rest and warmth by the watch-fires, Frederick
sat upon the lowest step of the altar and by
the dim light of a lamp wrote his orders for attack
on the following day, for he was determined to
make the battle decisive, whatever the cost. It was
hardly daybreak when he mounted his horse and
rode out of the village. He had not gone far when
he saw a cavalry troop approaching, with Zieten at
its head. In the tone of an officer reporting, he
said to the King, &ldquo;The enemy is beaten and has
retreated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frederick was much excited by the announcement.
With the activity of a boy, he jumped from
his horse, Zieten following his example, and embraced
his faithful general. Zieten cried like a
child. Then the two rode back to the field, by
different routes, to acquaint the troops with the
joyful news and thank them for the bravery they
had shown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>The King rode along the front, from the left to
the right wing, and approached the generals who
were gathered about the watch-fire. Frederick dismounted
and joined the brave officers and men of
his division, who were waiting for dawn to renew
the attack upon the Austrians if they had not
retreated. The King talked much with his soldiers
and praised them for their valor. The grenadiers,
knowing his amiability and condescension, crowded
nearer and nearer about him. One of them, with
whom the King had several times conversed and to
whom he had often given money, was bold enough
to ask him where he had been during the battle.
They were accustomed to seeing him at their head,
leading them into the thickest of the fight. This
time, however, not an eye had seen him, and it was
not right for him to forsake them. The King replied
most graciously to the grenadier, saying that
during most of the battle he had been at the left
wing of the army and therefore could not be with
his own men. While saying this, he unbuttoned
his blue overcoat, as he was getting too warm. As
he did so, the grenadier noticed a bullet falling
from his clothes and saw the wound on his breast
through the rent in his uniform. Excitedly he
shouted: &ldquo;Thou art still the old Fritz! Thou
sharest every danger with us. For thee we would die
gladly. Long live the King! Three times three!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>There was the greatest enthusiasm as Frederick
rode up and down the line, shaking hands with
this and that old graybeard and addressing a kindly
word to everyone. On this occasion the old grenadiers
were smoking wretched tobacco in their stub
pipes right under his nose. An officer, who knew
his dislike of tobacco, said to them, &ldquo;Step back a
little. His Majesty cannot endure tobacco smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, children, stay where you are,&rdquo; replied the
King, with a kindly smile. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the smell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was thus gracious to his soldiers&mdash;for it was
well known that he was averse to tobacco all his
life&mdash;and in this and other ways was constantly
manifesting his regard for them.</p>
<p>The loss of life at Torgau was very great on both
sides. The Austrians lost twenty thousand men
beside fifty-five cannon and twenty-seven standards,
and the Prussians suffered almost as severely.
Frederick, writing about it to a friend, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have just defeated the Austrians. They
have lost an extraordinary number as well as we.
This victory will perhaps allow us a little rest this
Winter and that is about all. Next year we must
begin anew. I have been hit by a shot, which
grazed my breast, but it is only a bruise,&mdash;little
pain, but no danger,&mdash;therefore I shall be as busy
as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Large as was the number killed in this battle, it
was compensated for by its important results, for
Prussia was saved and Saxony was once more freed
from the Austrians. The Russians had retired again
into Poland, and the Swedes had sought refuge in
the farthest corners of Pomerania. The King decided
to make his Winter quarters in Leipsic. On
his way there, he reached a Saxon village near Wittenburg
and took lodgings with a preacher. Delighted
with the honor conferred upon him, he
went to the door to meet the King, and said: &ldquo;Come
in, thou blessed of the Lord! Why dost thou
stand outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King regarded the preacher, a venerable old
man, with a kindly smile, and said to him: &ldquo;How
many taxpayers are there in this village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preacher was so astonished at the question
that he could hardly reply, although he knew the
number very well. At last he collected his wits
and said: &ldquo;Twenty-two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much do they raise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preacher stated the amount of grain in
bushels as nearly as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the village suffered much during the war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the last eight weeks, Your Majesty, your
troops and the Austrians have alternately foraged
here. We are about at the end, for we only have
our lives and cabins left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who represented the Austrians here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Luzinsky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he stop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the honor of entertaining him in my
house as well as I could.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;So? Did you also call him &lsquo;blessed of the
Lord&rsquo; when he came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means, but I could not curse him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! You are a Saxon. Now I shall see
whether I bring more blessings to this village than
Luzinsky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King was shown to his room, and made
much of the preacher, who greatly entertained him.
When he departed he paid him a hundred <i>Friedrich
d&rsquo;ors</i>, and left an order that if Prussian troops came
to the village they should take nothing, and should
pay for everything they got outside their quarters.</p>
<p>Frederick always liked to talk with the country
clergy. He resumed his march to Leipsic in more
cheerful spirits, but did not enter the city at once.
He had his night&rsquo;s lodgings at a parson&rsquo;s house in
one of the villages near Leipsic. He was kept
awake all night, for the house was overrun with
mice, which made much noise in his room. Frederick
arose at daybreak, called the pastor, and said:
&ldquo;Listen! Do you know anything about interpreting
dreams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not particularly, Your Majesty, for I am not
much of a believer in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not believe in them, but many a dream
has a real meaning. I will tell you of mine. I
dreamed your rooms were full of mice. What does
that signify?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think Heaven means me to understand by
this that my commissaries are good at plundering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Your Majesty, I fear your dream was
the result of natural causes; for, alas! I am very
much plagued by these vermin in my house and I
do not know how to get rid of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? then I must be wrong. Now you take
this <i>Friedrich d&rsquo;or</i> and buy yourself a mouse-trap.
Perhaps then I may sleep better the next time I
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frederick&rsquo;s enemies continued hoping that the
time would come, in the execution of their plans,
when they should find him exhausted by the weakness
of his forces; and prospects indeed seemed to
point that way. Doubtless he gained much by the
victory at Torgau, but his situation still was a difficult
one. He greatly deplored the losses his army
had suffered, for he saw no way of replacing them.
Signs of discontent were also beginning to appear
among his troops because they were not regularly
paid. This induced him, immediately after the
battle at Torgau, to abandon his original plan of
retaking Dresden. The following conversation
shows how serious he was in this purpose. Immediately
after the victory a grenadier asked: &ldquo;Your
Majesty, shall we now go into good Winter
quarters?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must first retake Dresden. After that, I
will look out for you and you shall be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In view of dissatisfactions among the soldiers and
the approach of cold, rainy weather, the King decided,
at the close of the year 1760, to go into
Winter quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Camp at Bunzelwilz</span></h2>
<p>The next year began less fortunately than
1760 closed. The enemy determined to
crush Frederick by weight of numbers.
It was a long time, however, before military
operations commenced. The King&rsquo;s forces had been
so weakened that he dared not take the offensive
without reserves to fall back upon. Nor did the
enemy dare to attack singly. Every effort was made
to overwhelm him by united strength. With this end
in view, in August, seventy-two thousand Austrians
under General Laudon joined the Russians, making
a total of one hundred and thirty thousand men,
while Frederick&rsquo;s army was hardly fifty thousand
strong. Frederick had never before confronted so
strong a combination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>At the beginning of Spring the King left Saxony
for Silesia, most of which was in the enemy&rsquo;s
possession. The march was made swiftly, for the
Austrians were establishing strong positions here
and there. One day, about noon, he approached a
Saxon village near the Bohemian frontier, in the
vicinity of which an entrenched position was held
by a detachment under the command of an Austrian
captain. As soon as he noticed the King&rsquo;s arrival
at the village, he began a vigorous fire. Frederick
was leaning against a shed, deep in thought, and at
first seemed to pay no attention to the firing. His
aides besought him to leave, as the place was too
dangerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bullet which is to hit me,&rdquo; said the King,
&ldquo;will come from above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later a shot struck a post three
yards away, quickly followed by a second. Remarking,
&ldquo;They are growing too discourteous,&rdquo; he
ordered the destruction of the nest. The entrenchment
was stormed and the captain and his men were
made prisoners. The Prussian soldiers took his
watch, purse, and whatever else of value he had
about him, and at last cut off the gold ornaments on
his hat. This he pronounced an insult, and demanded
to be taken to the King. After a respectful
greeting, the King said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your servant, my dear Captain. What can I
do for you?&rdquo; The captain complained of his ill
treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know the usages of war?&rdquo; said the
King. &ldquo;This is not a processional. Thank God
that you escaped with your life. My people are very
considerate after all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>The captain was surprised at the light manner in
which the King spoke, for, as he afterward said, he
had always supposed the conqueror of Silesia to be
a strong, imperious man.</p>
<p>The march was immediately resumed, and whenever
Austrians showed themselves they were dispersed.
Too weak to attack the Austrians at that
time investing Schweidnitz, the King kept on to
Bunzelwiltz, a very favorable position not far from
Schweidnitz, where an entrenched camp was established
in such a scientific and formidable manner
that it looked like a fortress. The work of entrenching
was rushed at every point, and officers joined
hands with the soldiers in the work. Earthworks
were also constructed in the churchyard in the village
of Jauernick by soldiers sent for that purpose,
who worked under the supervision of an officer. As
they were throwing up the earth an old box was
struck. They did not remove it with the usual care,
but broke it open a little and found there was money
in it. They would have instantly pounced upon it,
but the officer drove them back and took the box
himself, assuring them he would divide the money
fairly when the work was done. They were satisfied
with this, and the box was placed by the church
door. The officer quietly retired to an unseen
position, took off his stockings and went back with
bare feet in his boots. He then took the box,
shook the money out when unobserved, placed the
stockings on the bottom of it and threw in what
money it would hold. When the men were through
with their work they asked for the box. The officer
brought it at once, emptied out the money, and
showed them there was nothing more in it but some
old rags. There was great dissatisfaction, however,
for they suspected the captain was not dealing
fairly with them; seeing which, he threatened them
with a stick. At this juncture the King came up to
inspect the work. He asked what the matter was.
They related the whole occurrence to him, whereupon
he requested them to show him the box, the
money, and the pretended old rags. An old
grenadier, who had the latter in his hands, said:
&ldquo;Your Majesty, these are not old rags, but a
pair of linen-thread stockings with a name on
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Thereupon he showed them to the King, who
clearly enough saw the name &ldquo;V&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; on them.
The King summoned the officer and asked his
name. He answered &ldquo;V&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the King to the men, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
see the money belongs to him? His ancestors
buried it here. Here is his name on the stockings,
as plain as if it were put there recently. Stupids,
what do you mean? Give the officer his money.
I will have the box filled with genuine two-groschen
pieces, and they shall be divided equally among you.
Will that satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Your Majesty,&rdquo; was the answer of
all. They were all the better satisfied as the coins
in the box were mostly little old copper pieces.
In this way the King saved the officer from the
embarrassment naturally consequent upon discovery
of dishonesty, and left him standing speechless and
ashamed.</p>
<p>The defences were at last completed, and in that
strong position Frederick awaited whatever might
happen. As he was situated he could not undertake
an attack, and was forced to act upon the defensive.
Unusual precautions were taken in the
camp. During the day the men slept by turns,
and at night officers and men were awake and ready
for action. As a rule the King left his tent every
night, betook himself to a battery, and there awaited
the morning under the open heavens. One night,
as he was sitting upon the ground by the fire, enveloped
in his cloak, he seemed to be tired and
somewhat sleepy. A soldier of the Wolfersdorf
regiment, noticing it, said to him: &ldquo;I will make
Your Majesty a pillow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you do it?&rdquo; said the King.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>The soldier took off his knapsack and fixed it so
the King could rest his head upon it. He could
not sleep, however, and so he talked with the
soldier about his native land, his service, and other
things. The latter asked the King several rather
bold questions, which he answered very affably.
The following conversation occurred between them:</p>
<p><span class="sc">Soldier.</span> &ldquo;If Your Majesty should be taken
prisoner, how could you get released, as you are a
King?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">King.</span> &ldquo;As a general, not otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Soldier.</span> &ldquo;Hm! I don&rsquo;t believe that. You are
more than a general.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">King.</span> &ldquo;No! With the army I am only a
general.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Soldier</span> (shaking his head). &ldquo;They would
get rich booty if they took you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">King.</span> &ldquo;Oh, no, they would not. I have not
a groschen in my pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Soldier.</span> &ldquo;Your Majesty is trying to deceive
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">King.</span> &ldquo;No! I tell you I have not a kreutzer&rdquo;
(and to convince him, the King emptied his pockets).
&ldquo;There! do you not see I am right?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Soldier.</span> &ldquo;That is strange, but&mdash;you have a
beautiful ring, which certainly is worth something.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">King.</span> &ldquo;Well&mdash;and what do you think it is
worth? Give a guess.&rdquo; (Saying this, the King held
up the ring for his examination.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Soldier.</span> &ldquo;The ring may well have cost ten
thousand thalers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p><span class="sc">King.</span> &ldquo;Fool! I will let you have it for five
hundred thalers, and even then make money.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Soldier.</span> &ldquo;I would not believe that to all
eternity. It is not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">King.</span> &ldquo;Certainly it is. Look here&mdash;I will count
up the cost. This little stone here is perhaps worth
three hundred and some odd thalers. The large
one in the middle is a table diamond, which at the
utmost did not cost over thirty thalers, and the rest
of the ring, outside of the plain setting, is of no
value.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Soldier.</span> &ldquo;I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Day had dawned in the meantime. The King
arose and ordered an aide, who had come up to
make report, to give the soldier a <i>Friedrich d&rsquo;or</i>,
saying at the same time, &ldquo;Are you convinced now
that I have no money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frederick often availed himself of the darkness
to ride about and see what was going on. Once
the King and Zieten, riding early in the morning,
came to a little wood. Seeing no signs of an enemy
Frederick began whistling softly, as was often his
habit when not talking. All at once, as they
ascended an eminence, Zieten noticed some of the
enemy&rsquo;s troopers in the distance, wearing white
cloaks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Your Majesty. Quick, put my
white undercoat over your shoulders and ride
slowly. They will think we are friends coming to
meet them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This evidently was the Austrians&rsquo; opinion, for
they seemed to be directing their course straight
toward them; but suddenly the King and Zieten
put spurs to their horses, changed their direction,
and fortunately escaped. The King laughed and
said: &ldquo;My dear Zieten, that was a neat trick.
Now, can I go on with my whistling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As was always his habit, the King continued to
share all dangers and privations with his soldiers.
Like them, he ate out of tin dishes and the hard
ground was his bed whatever the weather might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take along a bundle of straw,&rdquo; he once said, as he
started for a ride through the camp, &ldquo;so that I won&rsquo;t
have to lie on the bare ground, as I did last night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>The King was forced to remain inactive for three
weeks in this distressing situation, for the combined
Russian and Austrian forces were stretched out until
they shut him in on all sides. He was in a critical
condition. His stores were giving out and his
troops were getting uneasy. He resolved therefore
to risk a decisive stroke. It was fortunate for him
that Laudon did not have supreme command, else
he would have been crushed. The larger part of
the army was under command of the Russian
Field-Marshal Butterlin, who disliked Laudon and
frequently quarrelled with him. This of course
prevented co&ouml;peration. If one favored attacking,
the other would refuse; if one gave an order to
assault at a certain point, the other would issue an
exactly contrary order. In this dissension lay the
possibility of the King&rsquo;s escape, though he did not
know it, for he had never heard even a hint of their
enmity. His situation appeared to him desperate
enough. Whichever way he turned he saw no
prospect of escape. This greatly disturbed him.
With an anxious heart he often hurried to old
Zieten&rsquo;s little hut for consolation. This brave general
confidently looked for better days in the future.
His devotion and loyalty to the King never permitted
him to doubt the success of his undertakings.
In sheer desperation, the King would often
say: &ldquo;It cannot be done; it is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whenever he said this, Zieten would reply:
&ldquo;Have courage, Your Majesty. Everything will
come out right.&rdquo; Once he said this with so much
assurance that the King quickly asked: &ldquo;Have
you secured the help of some new allies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the general, &ldquo;only our old help
from above, which will never forsake us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed the King, &ldquo;the days of miracles
are over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need of miracles,&rdquo; replied the pious
old hero. &ldquo;He is on our side and will not let us
be defeated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Brave Zieten spoke truly, for three weeks afterward
the Russians suddenly broke camp and departed.
The cause was partly the disagreement
between Butterlin and Laudon, but the principal
reason for the sudden exit was the difficulty of procuring
subsistence for man and beast. Silesia had
been the scene of war so long and had been so ravaged
that its people had to kill most of their animals
for food and had been living for some time in a
most wretched plight. It was manifestly impossible
therefore to feed this great army. To save his, the
Russian general had no alternative but to break
camp and hurry off to Poland. How delighted
was the King when he saw that he was freed from
the enemy&rsquo;s investment! It was with a strange
feeling he left the prison from which he had never
expected to escape alive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>The close of the year, however, brought fresh
trouble. The fortress of Schweidnitz, in Silesia, at
last fell into the hands of the Austrians, and this
strengthened the Russian force at Colberg, in the
East. Frederick&rsquo;s immediate situation was not very
enviable in any sense, for there had been a lack of
subsistence for his troops for a long time, resulting
in general discontent as well as disobedience. His
financial resources were also well-nigh exhausted.
But what made him most despondent was the great
shrinkage of his numerical strength and the apparent
impossibility of making it good. It was no longer
possible to maintain discipline among his troops
after they had been reduced to the bare necessities.
The <i>Garde du Corps</i> and <i>gens d&rsquo;armes</i>, who had
been most loyally devoted to the King, now loudly
asserted that if they were attacked, they would surrender.
Such was the spiritless condition of his
army! Is it any wonder the King was dejected as
he contemplated the situation? Only his feeling of
duty and his love for the Fatherland helped him
to bear this heavy burden of trouble and care. In
a letter written immediately after the taking of
Schweidnitz, he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This painful duty of service to the Fatherland
is a heavy burden. With sadness I see its glory
dimmed, its people despairing of deliverance, and
devastation everywhere. Fatherland! Beloved
name! Thy sorrows have moved me to devote
the last remaining energies of my unfortunate life to
thy rescue. Away with fruitless complaints&mdash;I will
again take the field. Patriotism inspires me. A
new day is dawning. I will revenge the State and
end its troubles. I will forget my own distress and
think only of it. My strong arm shall be its support.
Notwithstanding his inclinations one must
swim with the current, die for Fatherland, or accomplish
his purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Dawn of Peace</span></h2>
<p>The King entered upon another year with
serious anxiety, for he could not escape
the conviction that the longer the war
continued the worse was his situation.
His army was continually dwindling away. The
old and tried troops, with which he had almost done
wonders at the beginning of field operations, were
now nearly all gone. His former sources of money
had also run dry. Saxony, which until now had
helped him greatly with its generous contributions,
had paid out its last mark, and Prussia was so utterly
exhausted that it could do nothing in any
direction. With the enemy it was different. They
confronted him with renewed strength and increased
numbers. The combination of the two
great armies was the most serious danger to his
small force. It was by this combination that the
fall of Schweidnitz was hastened. Frederick saw
no prospect of victory anywhere, and yet the truth
of his saying, &ldquo;When necessity is greatest, help is
nearest,&rdquo; was confirmed at that very time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>The Empress Elizabeth of Russia,<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> a faithful ally
of Maria Theresa, died January 5, 1762. Both
empresses, in alliance with France, had sworn to ruin
the King of Prussia. Elizabeth&rsquo;s successor was
Peter III, who was friendly to the King, and who
at the very beginning of the war expressed his
regret that Russia had taken part in hostilities
against the King whom he greatly esteemed for his
heroism. Frederick knew this, and hence was inclined
to regard the death of the Empress as a
fortunate event which would make for his success.
He reckoned rightly, for hardly had Peter ascended
the throne before he sent a messenger with orders
to his army to retire from all of Frederick&rsquo;s provinces,
to release all prisoners without further ceremony,
and hand over the contents of the great
storehouses in Pomerania to the people living there
without cost. In place of a bitter enemy, the King
had a warm friend in Russia. On May fifth, Peter
made peace with Prussia; and not only this, but soon
afterward he sent Czernichef with his twenty thousand
men to join the Prussians. When this was
known, Sweden, which had also been a party to
the alliance, out of deference to Russia, decided to
forego the pleasure of making war upon Prussia
any longer. It did not waste any time in acquainting
Frederick with its wishes. In fact, the proposition
was made so suddenly that the great King
facetiously said to the messenger who brought it:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was not aware I had been at war with
Sweden. To be sure, I have heard of some dealings
which my General Belling has had with that
people, but they shall have peace if they wish it.&rdquo;
The treaty of peace with Sweden was concluded
May twenty-second.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>How suddenly the aspect of his affairs changed!
All at once Frederick was free from all danger, and
was in a position to attack once more. Up to this
time his weakness had forced him to act on the
defensive. Now he was able to take the offensive,
and make a stout resistance to his remaining enemies.
He did not wait long, but marched his army
with its Russian re&euml;nforcement into Silesia, to expel
the Austrians and save that province from the
enemy. Daun was seized with consternation when
he heard of the King&rsquo;s advance. He hastily fell
back, took a new position on the Burkersdorf hills,
and entrenched himself as well as he could. It was
Frederick&rsquo;s firm intention to attack the enemy at
that point, and he had even fixed the day upon
which he would measure strength with the foe, but
an entirely unexpected as well as unfortunate event
occurred, which frustrated all his plans and menaced
both him and the Fatherland. After ruling six
months, Peter was dethroned by conspirators, and
died shortly afterward.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> His wife, Catharine, was
made regent by the dominant party. The shrewd
Frederick may have anticipated such an occurrence,
for, in all his letters to the young Emperor, he
gave him much fatherly advice, and particularly
entreated him to be prudent in his administration,
and conciliatory in all his relations to his wife.
This was a fortunate thing for the King, for when
the ambitious Empress read this correspondence
she was so deeply touched by Frederick&rsquo;s attitude
toward her that she hastened negotiations for peace,
declared she would have nothing to do with the
war, and furthermore ordered her armies to return
home at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>The friendly sentiments of the Empress were
very agreeable to Frederick, and yet he was greatly
disappointed, as the Empress&rsquo; order came just at
the time he was about to strike a blow at the
enemy. It was necessary to strike quickly, and
yet he must act very cautiously. He knew the
weak side of General Czernichef, his love of gold,
and with this inducement he persuaded him to
make a show of marching out with his army and
occupying a threatening position, with the understanding
that after three days he should return
home. It was a rash act on the general&rsquo;s part, and
one that might easily have cost him his head;
but his good-will to the King, and his avarice,
overcame all scruples. Frederick, happy that his
wishes were now realized, vigorously attacked the
enemy at Burkersdorf, while the Russians held
their position, as agreed, a little distance off. Daun,
who was ignorant of this arrangement, feared Czernichef
and his strong force more than he did the
King, and sent a considerable force against him.
This was just what Frederick wished. This division
of the enemy&rsquo;s strength made the battle easier, and
the result was a complete victory for the Prussians.
When the Austrians approached, the Russians retired,
and on the day after the battle they began
their homeward march.</p>
<p>Frederick now set out for Schweidnitz, and most
skilfully and closely invested that fortress. His
impatience at the slow progress of his laborers excited
him to such a degree as to threaten serious
physical consequences, and one day he decided to be
bled in the open field. He inquired if there were a
surgeon near by, and one was brought. The King
alighted, took off his coat, seated himself, and the
operation began. The cut was already bleeding,
when a shell struck near the King, and sprinkled
him and the surgeon with blood. The surgeon
fled as fast as he could, leaving the King sitting.
The latter was perfectly composed, and ordered him
to come back and bandage the cut, adding some of
his very emphatic threats. The surgeon finally returned
in a very uneasy frame of mind. &ldquo;I know
your heart is in the right place; bandage the cut,&rdquo;
said the King. Half scared to death, the surgeon
did as he was ordered with trembling hands, after
which the King mounted and rode away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Notwithstanding all of Frederick&rsquo;s blustering the
laborers made slow progress on account of the hardness
of the soil, which the King did not take into
consideration. He visited his displeasure principally
upon his engineers. He spoke very harshly with a
staff captain of that corps about the trenches, and at
last in a burst of temper exclaimed: &ldquo;Go to the d&mdash;l!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer quietly withdrew, but the King called
him back and said: &ldquo;I wish that you would take
charge of the work and then it may get on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer at once replied: &ldquo;Your Majesty, I am
gratified that you will allow me to have a leg or an
arm shot off before I leave the service, but I have
great need of both, and beside, it will save Your
Majesty the expense of carrying me back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King was not displeased at his boldness, but
laughed and ordered him back to work and handsomely
remembered him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>The investment was now rapidly pushed on all
sides and the fall of the fortress was inevitable. At
this time Frederick had his headquarters at Peterswaldau,
not far from Reichenbach, where he was
much surprised by a sudden attack from the besieged.
After the Austrians were driven back the Prussians
strengthened their position, and the King decided
that on the following day he would celebrate the
victory by a general parade of the army. Frederick
rode out from Peterswaldau with the Prussian princes
to view the spectacle. A colonel from Schwerin,
seeing him approach, rode quickly forward to receive
his orders, but had the misfortune to be thrown
from his horse, which stumbled. He was uninjured,
and his horse waited quietly for him. The colonel
remounted and galloped to meet the King as if
nothing had happened. As they met, the King
said: &ldquo;You have had a fall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not from your favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the King&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;only out of the
saddle into the sand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>The storming of Schweidnitz was successful and
Frederick looked for important results to come from
its fall, especially hoping it would revive the old
battle spirit of his troops. This proved to be the
case. Almost immediately came the glad tidings that
Prince Henry, on the twenty-ninth of October, had
completely routed the enemy in a sanguinary battle
at Freiberg, Saxony. This was the last battle in
the Seven Years&rsquo; War, and good fortune did not
again desert Frederick. As gloriously and successfully
as he had maintained himself against the
Austrians and Russians did Henry in the last
year of the war maintain himself against the
French, notwithstanding the meagre help he received.
Though often forced to fall back, yet he
always managed to advance again and successfully
cope with the enemy. He so misled them by his
extraordinary craftiness that his marches and counter-marches
were a puzzle to the French. It was due
to his military discipline and strategic skill that he
won victories over a much stronger force at Billingshausen,
Wilhelmsthal, and Luttenberg. Next he
captured the capital at Cassel, November 1, 1762,
and was preparing to take advantage of the favorable
season to drive the French over the Rhine,
when his plans were interrupted by an unlooked-for
event. France asked for peace, and the King made
no delay in seizing the opportunity to secure what
he had long desired. The treaty between France,
England, and Prussia was formally negotiated
February 10, 1763.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">End of the Seven Years&rsquo; War</span></h2>
<p>Maria Theresa and the Elector
of Saxony realized that under such circumstances
as these they were in no
condition to continue the war alone
against Prussia and that, whether they would or
not, they must take steps to conclude a treaty of
peace. The Seven Years&rsquo; War had convinced both
of them that they could never take beautiful Silesia
from the hands of their brave enemies, much less
humble the Margrave of Brandenburg. So they
extended the hand of peace to the King. The
hunting castle of Hubertsburg<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> was selected as the
place for the negotiations and there the plenipotentiaries
made peace, the King of Prussia being
represented by Minister Von Herzberg. As he had
fought many enemies in the field he had to make
treaties with many, and they were concluded in such
an honorable and skilful manner that Frederick was
once more in possession of Silesia, and the county of
Glatz did not lose a foot of its old possessions.
The treaty was signed February 15, 1763, and
caused unbounded enthusiasm in city and country.
Those who have not experienced the horrors of war
have little idea of the true significance of the word
&ldquo;peace.&rdquo; It recalls Schiller&rsquo;s beautiful words:
&ldquo;Gentle peace, sweet concord, abide with us. May
that day never come when war&rsquo;s hordes shall devastate
this quiet valley and when the evening sky,
tinged with roseate hues, shall reflect the dreadful
glare of burning villages and towns.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Crowned with victory, the King returned to his
capital amid the rejoicings of his subjects. The
Berliners had arranged an ovation for the homecoming
hero. In view of the devastation and misery
caused by the war he declined an immediate reception.
On the thirtieth of March, a little later than he had
intended, he entered his capital in the dusk of evening,
remained there a short time, and then hastened
on to Potsdam and Charlottenburg. At the latter
place he one day summoned his musicians and fixed
a time at which they should sing the chorale, &ldquo;We
praise thee, O God.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>They assembled punctually, supposing that the
church would be filled with a large and brilliant
audience. Instead of this, the King alone appeared,
seated himself, and gave them the signal. The
singers began, and each one did his utmost to contribute
to the success of the performance. As the
music of the hymn of praise, majestic as a song of
cherubim, filled the house of God, Frederick was so
affected that he reverently fell upon his knees and
with tears in his eyes expressed his sincere gratitude
to the Almighty for his many deliverances and for
the help which had been vouchsafed him through
the long and dreadful war now so happily ended.
It was thus the victorious King celebrated his peace
festival, and his devout attitude was so impressive
that there was not a dry eye among the singers.
Never before had they taken part in such a solemn
and inspiring ceremony.</p>
<p>Frederick always spoke freely of the battles in
the long war and liked to hear the accounts of his
generals. On one occasion General Seydlitz was
dining with him at Potsdam. After a general conversation,
mention was made of the battle of Rossbach,
and the King said: &ldquo;My dear Seydlitz, I am
greatly indebted to you, to your officers, and to
your whole division for that victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seydlitz replied: &ldquo;Excuse me, Your Majesty, not
alone my division, but my chaplain, Balke, also
conducted himself most gallantly. When the
battle began he buckled on a sword and fought
splendidly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;He must
be rewarded in some special way for such unusual
service. The Provost<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> has just died. Balke shall
have the place.&rdquo; The chaplain was summoned to
Potsdam, and was not a little surprised to receive
an appointment to the vacant position.</p>
<p>The King extended his generosity not only in
individual cases, but all over the country. There
was urgent necessity to awaken fresh life and secure
prosperity once more for the exhausted provinces.
The war, which had been conducted with great
bitterness and sometimes barbarity, had not only
greatly distressed Prussia, but had left all Germany
in a wretched plight. An entire circuit of towns
and villages had been destroyed. The luxuriant
fields had been trodden down by hoofs of horses
and were lying waste. Entire villages were destitute
of men, for their former residents had either been
killed or driven away by the enemy. The Prussian
army alone lost over two hundred thousand men during
the war, and its allies, England, Hanover, Hesse,
and others one hundred and sixty thousand more.
The losses of the enemy were still greater, for they
amounted to more than half a million men. Austria
lost one hundred and forty thousand, Russia,
one hundred and twenty thousand, France twenty-two
thousand, Sweden, twenty-five thousand, and
the German Reich, twenty-eight thousand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Under such circumstances, it is not strange there
were not enough men left in the country to till the
soil. Women had to do that work, and in some
places there were not women enough. Consequently
the King issued an order to take a hundred
of the strongest boys from the Potsdam Orphan
Asylum, and set them at work in these depopulated
localities. He devised still other means to make
up this lack of men. He released Prussians from
the army, filled their places with foreign recruits,
and then ordered that as few Prussians as possible
should be enlisted until the deficiency was made
good. The number thus released was thirty thousand
seven hundred and eighty. Every effort was
made to assist them in the habits of self-reliance
and industrial life, and orders were also issued that
soldiers in such districts should be allowed to marry
without a license from the authorities. Many buildings
abandoned by their owners were going to ruin,
and more than thirteen thousand houses in Prussia
were destroyed. Fertile fields after the war looked
like a barren wilderness, for there was a lack of
seed-corn and products, and implements of every
kind needed to put them in good condition again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Gentry and peasants alike had been plundered
by so many armies, and had lost so much by contributions
and confiscations, that they were utterly
destitute. The enemy had left them nothing but
their lives. The country was not the only sufferer.
Prosperity was ruined and trade was dead in the
cities. There was no longer any regard for habits
of order, and the police administration was wretched.
The courts of justice and financial institutions had
been reduced to inaction by these frequent invasions
of the enemy. The silence of the laws had
made the people reckless and produced in them an
uncontrollable greed of gain. Nobles, merchants,
farmers, and laborers raised the prices of their commodities,
and their demands were exorbitant beyond
belief. The situation called for drastic remedies,
and the King, who was greatly concerned over the
country&rsquo;s condition, did not hesitate to apply them
in a practical way. He realized that the Provinces
could not recover unaided, and so he decided to
help them. By his orders Silesia had to contribute
three million; Pomerania and Neumark, one million
four hundred thousand; the Electorate, seven hundred
thousand; the Duchy of Cleve, one hundred
thousand, and the province of Prussia, eight hundred
thousand thalers. Beside this, he distributed
among the most needy localities twenty-five thousand
bushels of rye and meal, and seventeen thousand
bushels of oats taken from the public storehouses.
He went even further than this. He reduced the
army, and distributed thirty-five thousand horses
among the peasants and gentry. In those parts of
the country which had suffered most severely during
the war, particularly Crossen, Hohenstein, and
Halberstadt, the taxes were reduced one-half. In
Silesia the payment of taxes was suspended for six
months, and in Pomerania and Neumark for two
years. The gentry also received considerable sums
of money for the arrangement of their affairs and
the payment of debts, for their resources had been
so greatly impaired, money was so scarce, and credit
so uncertain, that there was otherwise no hope for
their recovery.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>It was not only cities and villages that were
ruined during this war. The discipline of the army
was so impaired by dissoluteness that more stringent
regulations had to be adopted. The work,
however, proceeded so slowly that permanent results
were not apparent until 1775. From that
time the army displayed the genuine military spirit.
Everything except the regulations governing enlistments
had been changed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>It was natural that by the reduction of the
army many a deserving soldier found himself badly
off. When the free battalions were organized, a
blacksmith&rsquo;s journeyman in a Silesian village enlisted
in the one commanded by Quintus Icilius, became
a corporal, and subsequently was promoted to the
position of major and was given the decoration for
merit. After the battalion was disbanded, he was
left to shift for himself, and as he could find nothing
better went back to the smithy, but still wore
his decoration. Seydlitz found him at work, and
inquired where he got that decoration. He told
his story, and Seydlitz told it to the King. Quintus
was in attendance upon the King, and, one day
at table, he said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quintus, you had some fine specimens of officers
in your battalion. There is, for instance, a
blacksmith journeyman who has decorated himself
with a service badge. How did that Cyclops come
by it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quintus replied: &ldquo;I remember the brave fellow.
I wish Your Majesty had had more such smiths in
the campaign. This one certainly did well, and
Your Majesty recognized his service and gave him
the decoration in Saxony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you not told me about him before?&rdquo;
said the King.</p>
<p>Quintus answered: &ldquo;It has been done, but Your
Majesty at the time was much prejudiced against
the free battalions and struck the name of this
brave fellow off the list.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>The King smiled and shaking his head, said:
&ldquo;He has had hard luck and I must help him some
way. Now, listen, I will give the man a pension
for service, but he must not wear his decoration
when at work and he must keep quiet until I call
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quondam major shortly after this received a
kindly letter, which assured him a generous pension
and made him the happiest of men.</p>
<p>Considering the care with which this sagacious
sovereign looked after matters in general as well as
individual affairs, and devoted himself to the humblest
as well as the greatest in his dominions, it is
not surprising that the ruined towns and villages,
and the waste lands as well, soon presented a changed
aspect, but it took years before the sorely oppressed
country recovered entirely from the devastating
effects of war. With the increasing industry of the
people, however, and the unfailing encouragement
and assistance of the King in advancing the interests
of commerce, trade, and agriculture, Prussia in time
rose to a higher degree of prosperity and culture
than ever before.</p>

or Margravate of Brandenburg was the beginning of the Kingdom
of Prussia. The Nordmark, now in Saxony, was founded by Henry I in 928 to
preserve certain German territory. In 1134 it was granted to Albert, who took
the title of Margrave of Brandenburg. The mark was gradually extended during the
next three centuries, and in 1618 the Duchy of Prussia was united to it. During the
reign of Frederick William, the &ldquo;Great Elector,&rdquo; it was largely developed, and in
1700 it became the Kingdom of Prussia.

<p class="center small"><i>A new, interesting, and very useful series that will be found especially
<br />suitable for school libraries and for supplementary reading</i></p>
<p>The books in this series are translated from the German, because
in that country a specialty is made of really desirable
reading for the young. Eight titles are now ready and more will
follow.</p>
<p>Their simplicity and accuracy make them very useful for every

provide a mild element of historical information, as well as first-class
entertainment, the little books will prove a veritable find.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;life-stories&rdquo; retain the story form throughout, and embody
in each chapter a stirring event in the life of the hero or the action
of the time. The dramatis person&aelig; are actual characters, and the
facts in the main are historically correct. They are therefore both
entertaining and instructive, and present biography in its most attractive

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
